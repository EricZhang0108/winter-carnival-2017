			<h1> The Strengths and Imperfections of the Greek System </h1>
			<h3> By: Alexa Green </h3>
			<img src="images/GLOS.jpg">
			<p>
			    On a small campus in the middle of the woods, a sense of community is
			    important. Where Dartmouth students find their communities varies.
			    According to director of the Office of Greek Life Brian Joyce, 46.3 percent
			    of students at the College are affiliated with Greek organizations,
			    equivalent to 62.6 percent of eligible students, as first-year students are
			    ineligible to join. The Greek system provides students with a unique
			    community of its own.
			</p>
			<p>
			    The Dartmouth fielded an online survey of students on community-related
			    topics, and the data from 532 student responses provided a tangible gauge
			    of how some Dartmouth students view the Greek system.
			</p>
			<p>
			    When asked how inclusive or exclusive they perceive the Greek system at
			    Dartmouth to be, 35.2 percent of men said “very inclusive,” while 13.8
			    percent of women said “very inclusive.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Chair of the Greek Leadership Council Austin Welch ’17 said that this year
			    the council identified five areas to improve upon: sexual violence, high
			    risk drinking, hazing, accountability and inclusivity. The GLC works to
			    serve the needs and interests of the students affiliated with recognized
			    open societies and Greek Letter Organizations. According to its
			    constitution, the GLC’s goals include maintaining the integrity of the
			    Greek community, which refers to Greek culture as it relates to civic,
			    academic, personal and community excellence.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Over the summer of 2015, Dartmouth Bystander Initiative training was
			    implemented for all new members joining a Greek organization. The program
			    assists students in recognizing and acting upon potential moments of harm.
			    During his sophomore summer, Welch said the GLC saw the need for
			    intervention training.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “We thought [members] were at a point where they had the opportunity to
			    speak up, but maybe felt concerned joining a new organization, that their
			    voice would be silenced or shamed,” he added. “So, what we worked to do is
			    make sure that anyone who saw something they felt uncomfortable with knew
			    they had the support of upperclassmen.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Joyce said there are multiple ways in which the Greek community has created
			    a place for active discussion surrounding inclusivity. One example was the
			    Panhellenic Council’s panel on inclusivity in the Greek system this past
			    summer.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “We had a really transparent, honest conversation about ways we are
			    inclusive and ways we still have exclusivity in our system, how that made
			    people feel and how we can address that,” Joyce said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    At the panel, some affiliated women talked about how they did not expect to
			    be involved in Greek life at Dartmouth because they were not stereotypical
			    sorority girls. However, Joyce noted that many were pleasantly surprised
			    that they found a home here, adding that they fit in and found their system
			    of support.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “However, on the flip side, people talked about how they felt like they had
			    to segment out certain parts of their life because certain friend groups
			    didn’t agree with Greek life,” Joyce said. “It’s a polarizing community
			    here at Dartmouth.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Megan Batangan ’18 is a member of Chi Delta sorority and participated on
			    Panhell’s inclusivity panel during her sophomore summer. She said she spoke
			    about her experience as a Native Hawaiian student and her involvement in
			    the Native American at Dartmouth community in tandem with that of her Greek
			    house.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “I recognize it is hard to change a system that was not necessarily made
			    for me,” she said. “It wasn’t made for females of color who come from a
			    lower socioeconomic background — I am partaking in a system that at the
			    beginning was made for wealthy white males.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    She added that she participates heavily in Greek life, attributing her very
			    active role in Chi Delt to her attempts to break down socioeconomic and
			    racial barriers.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Last spring, Sigma Delta sorority organized and co-hosted a panel on
			    inclusivity in the Greek system with Epsilon Kappa Theta and Chi Delt
			    sororities. Sigma Delt president Alanna Kane ’17 said that the panel was a
			    great way to express opinions and discuss ways to navigate a space on
			    campus.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “It’s not necessarily an easy thing, devoting a lot of time and attention
			    to building community as a social space,” she said. “Some people are
			    interested in the house as a social space, and some are interested in it as
			    a community.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Kane added that Sigma Delt members work to make their house a space where
			    people can hang out, get along and feel safe, in order to minimize tensions
			    among members.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Joyce also said that the work from individual chapters in the
			    Interfraternity Council can be the start to having a larger, community-wide
			    discussion on inclusivity.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Alpha Chi [Alpha fraternity], in the fall, held a discussion on race —
			    within the Dartmouth community, nationally and their fraternity — and how
			    white privilege intersects with that,” he said. “Hopefully others will have
			    some of those discussion as well.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Joyce added that Gamma Delta Chi fraternity has a high percentage of
			    athletes and had a conversation on “locker room talk,” facilitating the
			    support of a safe environment.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Tabard gender-inclusive fraternity president Paul Vickers ’19 said that the
			    organization is recreating its constitution to state actively in its bylaws
			    that they support the rights of all minority groups.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “We are defining what inclusivity means because in the past, related to the
			    incident that got us kicked off campus, there have been issues with open
			    access,” Vickers said. “The idea that every single person can rush maybe
			    wasn’t the greatest thing because there wasn’t any filter, but also
			    inherently we want to be inclusive to all people.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Vickers said that his fraternity is a strong supporter of the Black Lives
			    Matters movement, as well as other groups on campus, noting that Tabard has
			    a strong Native American population.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Many members of Tabard do not fit in the traditional systems, he said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “We have the most identifying minorities, percentage-wise, and have the
			    lowest income, percentage-wise,” Vickers added. “We span pretty broadly but
			    come together with shared experience.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Additionally, financial inclusivity is being addressed by both the GLC and
			    Panhell. The GLC is currently creating a policy and program to aid
			    organizations supply financial aid to their members. Welch said that all
			    Greek membership is officially need-blind.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Financial need won’t be taken into consideration and won’t be a problem
			    for those who are looking to join,” Welch added.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Previously Panhell focused on programming, such as last year’s dance
			    marathon and panels, to facilitate discussion. Chair of Panhell Lauren Huff
			    ’17 said Panhell was unable to meet all of the scholarship requests for
			    sorority houses last year.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “So, in the spring, we then decided we wanted to focus our efforts and
			    money there,” she said. “We are trying to provide scholarship and lower the
			    barriers to be a part of an organization.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    One of the barriers addressed by Panhell women is the gap between
			    first-year women and upperclassmen women, Huff said. At Dartmouth, students
			    are eligible to join a fraternity, sorority or gender-inclusive
			    organization their sophomore year.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “[Freshmen] are not inherently coming into sorority houses,” Joyce said. “I
			    talked to so many [potential new members] and sorority women where
			    recruitment is the first time they have stepped into a sorority space.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    “I think there is a big divide between class year at Dartmouth,” Huff said.
			    “It’s very much an identifier.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    She added that the six-week freshman fraternity ban creates a divide
			    between freshmen women and affiliated upperclassmen women.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “I think there are definitely ways to bridge that gap,” Huff said.
			    “However, there is a stigma — whenever anything is associated with rush,
			    people get freaked out and nervous.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    The formal recruitment process is run by Panhell. According to its website,
			    during the first round, a potential new member attends a party at each of
			    the eight Panhell chapters. After the first round, a maximum of four houses
			    will invite potential new members back to attend a second round of parties.
			    Following the second round, potential new members will be invited back to a
			    maximum of two houses at preference night, which is the final round of
			    recruitment. After attending these parties, the potential new members meet
			    with their Recruitment Counselors, ranking the houses they attended.
			    Following this, the women will be granted a bid, which is an invitation to
			    become a member of that chapter. Later that night, new members will be
			    welcomed at their new sorority.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Sigma Delt and EKT hold “shake-out,” which mirrors the IFC’s recruitment
			    process.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Alpha Pi Omega sorority, Sigma Lambda Upsilon/Señoritas Latinas Unidas
			    sorority and Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority fall under different organizations
			    from Panhell and have different recruitment processes.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Recruitment occurs every fall, winter and spring for the IFC; some chapters
			    will only take new members during certain terms. The IFC’s official
			    recruitment process occurs over the course of three nights. On the first
			    two nights of recruitment, potential new members visit the fraternities
			    that they are interested in joining. There, they are allowed to “shake-out”
			    at one fraternity at the end of the evening, which indicates the potential
			    new member’s top choice. Fraternities deliberate and give out bids any time
			    after the formal recruitment process starts. While a potential new member
			    can receive bids from more than one organization, they can only accept one
			    bid. For some fraternities, a third night of men’s recruitment is used for
			    call-backs.
			</p>
			<p>
			    The specific recruitment process for gender-inclusive organizations, such
			    as Tabard and Panarchy undergraduate society, is different for each
			    organization.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Huff said that the Greek recruitment process promotes community by being an
			    inclusive and open system.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Recruitment gives everyone an equal chance,” Huff said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    She added that the number of connections a potential new member has in a
			    certain house does not affect the choices made throughout the process.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “The aim is to have potential new members come in open minded and see every
			    house,” she said. “But it’s an inherently exclusive system just by the
			    nature of what it is.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Batangan said that based on the stereotypes portrayed in the media, she did
			    not originally think she was suited for Greek life.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Throughout the rush process, I met so many cool upperclass[men] women who
			    I would’ve never had the chance to meet otherwise without the rush process,
			    when I was literally forced to sit down and talk to them in their houses,”
			    she said. “I wanted another community to add onto my already very strong
			    NAD community.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Sigma Delt’s shake-out process was established with the goal of providing
			    potential new members with as much agency as possible, Kane said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “They are coming here because they are interested in meeting people and
			    seeing what the house is, then maybe coming again and saying that ‘I’d like
			    to be a part of this space,’” she added.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Joyce, however, said he recognizes the pressure that the size of the Greek
			    community can impose.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “There is almost this desperation about [joining a Greek house],” he said.
			    “Here [students] feel like, ‘I have to get into a sorority because,
			    especially for sophomore summer and other times, it’s such a big thing here
			    and it’s not an option — I need to do this.’”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Since there are so many affiliated students on campus, Greek life can be
			    crucial to people feeling like they fit in, Joyce added.
			</p>
			<p>
			    The ways in which each of the 28 College-recognized Greek organizations
			    fosters community is different depending on the house. Some are
			    member-focused and close-knit, while others develop a larger open and
			    welcoming space.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “By the time our members are brothers, our community is already formed,”
			    Sigma Nu fraternity president Lotanna Ezenwa ’17 said. “The formal
			    recruitment process is not as applicable to us because we’re just a group
			    of friends that like to hang out with each other.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    He added that Sig Nu’s recruitment process regards strong friendships in
			    the house and involvement in their established community.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “[Tabard is] more of a community for our members and focused on the house
			    itself, more than on the outside community,” Vickers said. “There is an
			    interesting balance between a Greek house that is much more open and
			    inviting, hosting more events, and a Greek house like ours, which is much
			    more community-based and member-focused.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Many regard their houses to be an aggregation from different parts of
			    campus, creating a unique environment.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “When I walk into Chi Delt as a space, I know I will be surrounded by girls
			    who don’t think the same way I do or act the same way I do or are
			    interested in the same things I am interested in,” Batangan said. “That’s
			    exactly why I came to college, to grow and be challenged.”
			</p>

			    With weekly home-cooked meals and “Delta dates” over sophomore summer,
			    Batangan said that Chi Delt works to “break down barriers so people can
			    feel like they can be their whole selves stepping into Chi Delt.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Kane added that Sigma Delt works to be an inclusive community for all
			    self-identifying women on campus.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “We have so many different people who are interested in different things,
			    involved in different sports, performance groups, and people who generally
			    would not have met without that connection of the house,” she said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    The Dartmouth community undergoes unique transitions, frequently revolving
			    around the D-Plan. During sophomore summer, only the sophomore class is on
			    campus. In The Dartmouth’s survey, 90.1 of affiliated students said they
			    felt “very connected” or “somewhat connected” to social life and activity
			    on campus during sophomore summer, compared to the 52.5 percent of
			    unaffiliated students that said the same.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “[Sophomore summer] is definitely different because it can be pretty
			    Greek-centered – you have a lot of people living in their organizations, if
			    they’re affiliated, or living with friends off campus,” said Kane, adding
			    that there is a “different vibe.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    In the same survey, among sophomores, juniors and seniors, 76.4 percent of
			    unaffiliated and 58.2 percent of affiliated students agree that Dartmouth
			    needs more alternative spaces social spaces to Greek houses on campus. Of
			    the freshmen responses, 59.3 percent agree with the statement. One such
			    space that considers community a pillar of its foundation is the Collis
			    Center.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Collis Governing Board president Sean Cann ’17 said that he thinks Collis
			    provides a great alternative social space for students.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Cann added that the board has been intentionally focusing on weekly
			    programming this year, pointing out Microbrew Mondays and Trivia Tuesdays
			    as examples.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “It’s nice to have consistent events every week that people can show up to
			    and know they have a place there,” he said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Greek life at the College is not limited to one single narrative for the
			    whole student population, Welch said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “I think one of the best parts of our community here is that it means
			    something different to every person,” said Welch. “It’s about creating a
			    sense of unity, while trying your best not to make anyone feel excluded.”

			<h1> Faculty and Staff Evaluate the Community at Dartmouth </h1>
			<h3> By: Julian Nathan </h3>
			<p>
			    Dartmouth’s commitment to fostering a supportive community is highlighted
			    prominently on the College’s website and in its marketing materials.
			    However, faculty and staff at the College have differing opinions on
			    whether Dartmouth has succeeded in its efforts to create the inclusive
			    community it promotes and publicizes. Some of the new changes implemented
			    by the Moving Dartmouth Forward initiative, such as the house communities
			    and an increased focus on academic rigor, seem to be having an effect on
			    the sense of community felt on campus.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Peter Marsh of facilities, operations &amp; management, who has spent over
			    30 years working at Dartmouth and is a former trustee for Dartmouth’s
			    branch of the Service Employees International Union, said that he has
			    observed some negative changes in Dartmouth’s community atmosphere over the
			    years.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Marsh explained that students seem to be more academically stressed than
			    ever before. He added that students’ increased focus on academics might
			    have come at the expense of long-standing Dartmouth traditions. Among the
			    traditions he said that Dartmouth has lost is the construction of snow
			    sculptures during Winter Carnival.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Marsh, who grew up in Hanover, recounted a time decades ago when students
			    built snow sculptures “everywhere.” He added that now, it seems that
			    students are too busy to build any snow sculptures at all. On Jan. 13, a
			    campus-wide email announcement from the Winter Carnival Council explained
			    that “many years of declining involvement from the student body” led the
			    Council to focus its efforts on other Winter Carnival events. The Council
			    also listed decreasing snowfall and an absence of student leadership as
			    reasons for its decision.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Marsh remarked that over the years, campus-wide enthusiasm about events
			    like Homecoming seems to have gradually decreased.
			</p>
			<p>
			    The loss of these traditions could be tied to a larger change in
			    Dartmouth’s community atmosphere as a whole, he said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Marsh also said that, in the last decade, a strain of elitism has pervaded
			    campus. He said that this elitism was not entirely contained within the
			    student body. On some occasions, Marsh said he has felt as though Dartmouth
			    community members have treated him as “the help.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    He also said that over the years, political correctness has stifled free
			    speech and open discussion on campus. According to Marsh, students used to
			    be more receptive towards more conservative publications like The Dartmouth
			    Review.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Students do not want to read anything that they do not agree with, he
			    added.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Still, on the whole, community at Dartmouth is more of a positive factor
			    than a negative one, Marsh said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Physics professor Ryan Hickox, who is also West House’s house professor,
			    said he has not noticed any negative trends in student behavior towards
			    each other, faculty and staff during the six years he has worked at the
			    College. While there are some isolated instances where students are
			    disrespectful towards others, these incidents appear to have become less
			    common throughout his time at Dartmouth, he added.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Dartmouth Dining Services supervisor Gordon Wright said that he has not
			    noticed any trends related to elitism or increased academic stress on
			    campus.
			</p>
			<p>
			    He characterized all of the interactions that he has had with students
			    during his seven-year tenure at DDS as positive, noting that he becomes
			    especially familiar with athletic teams that frequent the Class of 1953
			    Commons.
			</p>
			<p>
			    He added that most of the interactions he has witnessed occurring between
			    students have been positive.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Hickox said that house communities might further strengthen the College’s
			    campus community as future classes become more involved in the programming.
			    He said that house communities could facilitate “genuine interactions among
			    diverse groups of people.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    House communities also facilitate interactions between faculty members who
			    might otherwise not have ever crossed paths, he said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Our house communities provide an opportunity for faculty members in
			    different departments to get together in a purely social environment,”
			    Hickox added.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Wright also said that DDS’ policy of providing faculty members with
			    discounted prices, as well as the Paganucci Lounge, which provides faculty
			    with a space to dine with colleagues, have attracted more faculty to eat at
			    ’53 Commons. The increasing presence of College faculty at the dining hall
			    has allowed him to become familiar with faculty members he might not have
			    otherwise encountered, he said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Marsh, however, said that the College has felt increasingly impersonal and
			    corporate, adding that Dartmouth’s previously-existing personal culture set
			    it apart from other universities.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Hickox said that he has not observed any degradation in the College’s
			    ideals of civility, respect, empathy and rigor in his time at the College.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Most of the things that I see happening on campus give me a very positive
			    sense of where the community is going,” he said. “The vast majority of the
			    interactions that I see [occurring between students] are really positive.”

			<h1> Faculty Attracted to the Teaching Atmosphere at the College </h1>
			<h3> By: Marie-Capucine Pineau-Valencienne </h3>
			<p>
			    When we think of “Dartmouth,” we think of our friends, our scenic campus
			    and of course, our professors — but do the faculty at the College also feel
			    a unique sense of community? One of the most defining elements of a
			    “Dartmouth education” is learning what the word “community” really means.
			    At Dartmouth our sense of community sets our experience apart from others
			    and what, ironically, binds us all together. There is a reason why
			    Dartmouth has one of the most loyal and far-reaching alumni networks.
			    There’s a reason why alumni and families religiously flood into Hanover
			    every Homecoming weekend. And there’s a reason why the student body as a
			    whole is seemingly clothed in one particular shade of green. That reason?
			    Community.
			    <br/>
			</p>
			<p>
			    The concept of “Dartmouth” is much more than a charming New England Ivy
			    League institution. It’s much more than the pretty facade of Dartmouth Hall
			    or the echo of the clock in Baker Tower. The Dartmouth we know and love is
			    composed of the people who populate and give life to our seemingly idyllic
			    campus. Our vigorous sense of community is a reflection of not only the
			    dynamic student body but also the faculty who captain our big green ship.
			</p>
			<p>
			    According to history professor Edward Miller, who has taught at the College
			    for 13 years, there is in fact “a very strong community among the faculty
			    at Dartmouth.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    As I spoke to different professors about why they decided to stay at
			    Dartmouth, I quickly realized that our hybrid identity as both an
			    undergraduate college and a top-tier research university was one of the
			    most attractive aspects to many of the long-residing faculty.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Dartmouth is the only school I know of that really tries to split the
			    difference, that really emphasizes that they want their faculty to be both
			    excellent teachers and cutting edge outstanding researchers,” Miller said.
			    “And so for me that’s the most distinctive thing about Dartmouth.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    According to Miller, another benefit of teaching at Dartmouth is the size
			    of the faculty community. He said that the College has a large enough
			    faculty group to introduce diversity, though it is not as big as other
			    high-level research universities.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “At some of these large research universities you can spend your whole
			    career there and never get to know people in many other departments because
			    the community is just too big,” Miller said. “Here at Dartmouth, if you
			    stay here long enough you will meet most of your colleagues, even in other
			    departments and other divisions.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Miller added that he likes that his “primary home,” the history department,
			    is medium-sized, because it allows faculty in the department to specialize
			    in their teaching.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “You can teach courses on the area of your research specialty,” he said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Dean of the faculty of arts and sciences and government professor Michael
			    Mastanduno, who has been a faculty member at the College for over 30 years,
			    echoed Miller’s sentiments on Dartmouth’s “rare” balance between teaching
			    and research.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Dartmouth is a place where it really brings the two together, and it gives
			    faculty members time and resources to be leading scholars but also creates
			    a culture where the undergraduate experience is a top priority,” Mastanduno
			    said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Mastanduno said he observed how many of the faculty “really engage in the
			    culture here.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    “It’s a small community, but it’s also cultural,” he said. “There’s a sense
			    here, for example, that faculty members feel they should participate in the
			    governance of the school.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Mastanduno added that faculty are involved in the College community through
			    their engagement in its governance. Faculty care about their colleagues and
			    the success of the institution, he said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Even those who never envisioned a career in academia have found a home at
			    Dartmouth. After working on economic policy in Washington, D.C. and
			    Chicago, Illinois, economics professor Douglas Irwin said he knew that he
			    wanted to pursue a career in academia, but for his wife, fellow economics
			    professor Marjorie Rose, the feeling was not exactly mutual. The couple,
			    who have been staples of the Dartmouth economics department for 19 years,
			    explained how slowly but surely, Rose came to adopt Dartmouth as a new home
			    for their family.
			</p>
			<p>
			    In the process of acclimating to her new career path after leaving her job
			    at the International Monetary Fund in D.C., Rose said she discovered a love
			    for teaching she never knew she had before.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “I just love teaching Dartmouth students,” she said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Rose and Irwin described that being both a couple and professors in the
			    same department has ultimately allowed them to become better educators.
			    They explained how they are able to lean on each other and ask, “What are
			    the things that are interesting to our students?”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Irwin and Rose said they found a community at the College through their
			    relationship with their students. For nine years now the couple said they
			    have hosted “senior women dinners” at their home. They added that
			    conversations during one of these student dinners was the “impetus for the
			    Political Economy Project,” a program directed by Irwin.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Similarly, Miller and Mastanduno also said their students were an important
			    reason that they were inclined to engage in the Dartmouth community.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “I really do think that the students are the best thing about Dartmouth,”
			    Miller said. “I think that as a group, you will not find a group of
			    undergraduates who are more committed to learning for learning’s sake.”
