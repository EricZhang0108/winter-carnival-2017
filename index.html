			<h1> The Strengths and Imperfections of the Greek System </h1>
			<h3> By: Alexa Green </h3>
			<p>
			    On a small campus in the middle of the woods, a sense of community is
			    important. Where Dartmouth students find their communities varies.
			    According to director of the Office of Greek Life Brian Joyce, 46.3 percent
			    of students at the College are affiliated with Greek organizations,
			    equivalent to 62.6 percent of eligible students, as first-year students are
			    ineligible to join. The Greek system provides students with a unique
			    community of its own.
			</p>
			<img src="images/GLOS.jpg" width = "550" height = "380" align = "left" hspace = "50" vspace = "50">
			<p>
			    The Dartmouth fielded an online survey of students on community-related
			    topics, and the data from 532 student responses provided a tangible gauge
			    of how some Dartmouth students view the Greek system.
			</p>
			<p>
			    When asked how inclusive or exclusive they perceive the Greek system at
			    Dartmouth to be, 35.2 percent of men said “very inclusive,” while 13.8
			    percent of women said “very inclusive.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Chair of the Greek Leadership Council Austin Welch ’17 said that this year
			    the council identified five areas to improve upon: sexual violence, high
			    risk drinking, hazing, accountability and inclusivity. The GLC works to
			    serve the needs and interests of the students affiliated with recognized
			    open societies and Greek Letter Organizations. According to its
			    constitution, the GLC’s goals include maintaining the integrity of the
			    Greek community, which refers to Greek culture as it relates to civic,
			    academic, personal and community excellence.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Over the summer of 2015, Dartmouth Bystander Initiative training was
			    implemented for all new members joining a Greek organization. The program
			    assists students in recognizing and acting upon potential moments of harm.
			    During his sophomore summer, Welch said the GLC saw the need for
			    intervention training.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “We thought [members] were at a point where they had the opportunity to
			    speak up, but maybe felt concerned joining a new organization, that their
			    voice would be silenced or shamed,” he added. “So, what we worked to do is
			    make sure that anyone who saw something they felt uncomfortable with knew
			    they had the support of upperclassmen.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Joyce said there are multiple ways in which the Greek community has created
			    a place for active discussion surrounding inclusivity. One example was the
			    Panhellenic Council’s panel on inclusivity in the Greek system this past
			    summer.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “We had a really transparent, honest conversation about ways we are
			    inclusive and ways we still have exclusivity in our system, how that made
			    people feel and how we can address that,” Joyce said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    At the panel, some affiliated women talked about how they did not expect to
			    be involved in Greek life at Dartmouth because they were not stereotypical
			    sorority girls. However, Joyce noted that many were pleasantly surprised
			    that they found a home here, adding that they fit in and found their system
			    of support.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “However, on the flip side, people talked about how they felt like they had
			    to segment out certain parts of their life because certain friend groups
			    didn’t agree with Greek life,” Joyce said. “It’s a polarizing community
			    here at Dartmouth.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Megan Batangan ’18 is a member of Chi Delta sorority and participated on
			    Panhell’s inclusivity panel during her sophomore summer. She said she spoke
			    about her experience as a Native Hawaiian student and her involvement in
			    the Native American at Dartmouth community in tandem with that of her Greek
			    house.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “I recognize it is hard to change a system that was not necessarily made
			    for me,” she said. “It wasn’t made for females of color who come from a
			    lower socioeconomic background — I am partaking in a system that at the
			    beginning was made for wealthy white males.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    She added that she participates heavily in Greek life, attributing her very
			    active role in Chi Delt to her attempts to break down socioeconomic and
			    racial barriers.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Last spring, Sigma Delta sorority organized and co-hosted a panel on
			    inclusivity in the Greek system with Epsilon Kappa Theta and Chi Delt
			    sororities. Sigma Delt president Alanna Kane ’17 said that the panel was a
			    great way to express opinions and discuss ways to navigate a space on
			    campus.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “It’s not necessarily an easy thing, devoting a lot of time and attention
			    to building community as a social space,” she said. “Some people are
			    interested in the house as a social space, and some are interested in it as
			    a community.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Kane added that Sigma Delt members work to make their house a space where
			    people can hang out, get along and feel safe, in order to minimize tensions
			    among members.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Joyce also said that the work from individual chapters in the
			    Interfraternity Council can be the start to having a larger, community-wide
			    discussion on inclusivity.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Alpha Chi [Alpha fraternity], in the fall, held a discussion on race —
			    within the Dartmouth community, nationally and their fraternity — and how
			    white privilege intersects with that,” he said. “Hopefully others will have
			    some of those discussion as well.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Joyce added that Gamma Delta Chi fraternity has a high percentage of
			    athletes and had a conversation on “locker room talk,” facilitating the
			    support of a safe environment.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Tabard gender-inclusive fraternity president Paul Vickers ’19 said that the
			    organization is recreating its constitution to state actively in its bylaws
			    that they support the rights of all minority groups.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “We are defining what inclusivity means because in the past, related to the
			    incident that got us kicked off campus, there have been issues with open
			    access,” Vickers said. “The idea that every single person can rush maybe
			    wasn’t the greatest thing because there wasn’t any filter, but also
			    inherently we want to be inclusive to all people.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Vickers said that his fraternity is a strong supporter of the Black Lives
			    Matters movement, as well as other groups on campus, noting that Tabard has
			    a strong Native American population.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Many members of Tabard do not fit in the traditional systems, he said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “We have the most identifying minorities, percentage-wise, and have the
			    lowest income, percentage-wise,” Vickers added. “We span pretty broadly but
			    come together with shared experience.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Additionally, financial inclusivity is being addressed by both the GLC and
			    Panhell. The GLC is currently creating a policy and program to aid
			    organizations supply financial aid to their members. Welch said that all
			    Greek membership is officially need-blind.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Financial need won’t be taken into consideration and won’t be a problem
			    for those who are looking to join,” Welch added.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Previously Panhell focused on programming, such as last year’s dance
			    marathon and panels, to facilitate discussion. Chair of Panhell Lauren Huff
			    ’17 said Panhell was unable to meet all of the scholarship requests for
			    sorority houses last year.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “So, in the spring, we then decided we wanted to focus our efforts and
			    money there,” she said. “We are trying to provide scholarship and lower the
			    barriers to be a part of an organization.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    One of the barriers addressed by Panhell women is the gap between
			    first-year women and upperclassmen women, Huff said. At Dartmouth, students
			    are eligible to join a fraternity, sorority or gender-inclusive
			    organization their sophomore year.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “[Freshmen] are not inherently coming into sorority houses,” Joyce said. “I
			    talked to so many [potential new members] and sorority women where
			    recruitment is the first time they have stepped into a sorority space.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    “I think there is a big divide between class year at Dartmouth,” Huff said.
			    “It’s very much an identifier.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    She added that the six-week freshman fraternity ban creates a divide
			    between freshmen women and affiliated upperclassmen women.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “I think there are definitely ways to bridge that gap,” Huff said.
			    “However, there is a stigma — whenever anything is associated with rush,
			    people get freaked out and nervous.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    The formal recruitment process is run by Panhell. According to its website,
			    during the first round, a potential new member attends a party at each of
			    the eight Panhell chapters. After the first round, a maximum of four houses
			    will invite potential new members back to attend a second round of parties.
			    Following the second round, potential new members will be invited back to a
			    maximum of two houses at preference night, which is the final round of
			    recruitment. After attending these parties, the potential new members meet
			    with their Recruitment Counselors, ranking the houses they attended.
			    Following this, the women will be granted a bid, which is an invitation to
			    become a member of that chapter. Later that night, new members will be
			    welcomed at their new sorority.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Sigma Delt and EKT hold “shake-out,” which mirrors the IFC’s recruitment
			    process.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Alpha Pi Omega sorority, Sigma Lambda Upsilon/Señoritas Latinas Unidas
			    sorority and Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority fall under different organizations
			    from Panhell and have different recruitment processes.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Recruitment occurs every fall, winter and spring for the IFC; some chapters
			    will only take new members during certain terms. The IFC’s official
			    recruitment process occurs over the course of three nights. On the first
			    two nights of recruitment, potential new members visit the fraternities
			    that they are interested in joining. There, they are allowed to “shake-out”
			    at one fraternity at the end of the evening, which indicates the potential
			    new member’s top choice. Fraternities deliberate and give out bids any time
			    after the formal recruitment process starts. While a potential new member
			    can receive bids from more than one organization, they can only accept one
			    bid. For some fraternities, a third night of men’s recruitment is used for
			    call-backs.
			</p>
			<p>
			    The specific recruitment process for gender-inclusive organizations, such
			    as Tabard and Panarchy undergraduate society, is different for each
			    organization.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Huff said that the Greek recruitment process promotes community by being an
			    inclusive and open system.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Recruitment gives everyone an equal chance,” Huff said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    She added that the number of connections a potential new member has in a
			    certain house does not affect the choices made throughout the process.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “The aim is to have potential new members come in open minded and see every
			    house,” she said. “But it’s an inherently exclusive system just by the
			    nature of what it is.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Batangan said that based on the stereotypes portrayed in the media, she did
			    not originally think she was suited for Greek life.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Throughout the rush process, I met so many cool upperclass[men] women who
			    I would’ve never had the chance to meet otherwise without the rush process,
			    when I was literally forced to sit down and talk to them in their houses,”
			    she said. “I wanted another community to add onto my already very strong
			    NAD community.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Sigma Delt’s shake-out process was established with the goal of providing
			    potential new members with as much agency as possible, Kane said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “They are coming here because they are interested in meeting people and
			    seeing what the house is, then maybe coming again and saying that ‘I’d like
			    to be a part of this space,’” she added.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Joyce, however, said he recognizes the pressure that the size of the Greek
			    community can impose.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “There is almost this desperation about [joining a Greek house],” he said.
			    “Here [students] feel like, ‘I have to get into a sorority because,
			    especially for sophomore summer and other times, it’s such a big thing here
			    and it’s not an option — I need to do this.’”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Since there are so many affiliated students on campus, Greek life can be
			    crucial to people feeling like they fit in, Joyce added.
			</p>
			<p>
			    The ways in which each of the 28 College-recognized Greek organizations
			    fosters community is different depending on the house. Some are
			    member-focused and close-knit, while others develop a larger open and
			    welcoming space.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “By the time our members are brothers, our community is already formed,”
			    Sigma Nu fraternity president Lotanna Ezenwa ’17 said. “The formal
			    recruitment process is not as applicable to us because we’re just a group
			    of friends that like to hang out with each other.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    He added that Sig Nu’s recruitment process regards strong friendships in
			    the house and involvement in their established community.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “[Tabard is] more of a community for our members and focused on the house
			    itself, more than on the outside community,” Vickers said. “There is an
			    interesting balance between a Greek house that is much more open and
			    inviting, hosting more events, and a Greek house like ours, which is much
			    more community-based and member-focused.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Many regard their houses to be an aggregation from different parts of
			    campus, creating a unique environment.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “When I walk into Chi Delt as a space, I know I will be surrounded by girls
			    who don’t think the same way I do or act the same way I do or are
			    interested in the same things I am interested in,” Batangan said. “That’s
			    exactly why I came to college, to grow and be challenged.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    With weekly home-cooked meals and “Delta dates” over sophomore summer,
			    Batangan said that Chi Delt works to “break down barriers so people can
			    feel like they can be their whole selves stepping into Chi Delt.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Kane added that Sigma Delt works to be an inclusive community for all
			    self-identifying women on campus.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “We have so many different people who are interested in different things,
			    involved in different sports, performance groups, and people who generally
			    would not have met without that connection of the house,” she said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    The Dartmouth community undergoes unique transitions, frequently revolving
			    around the D-Plan. During sophomore summer, only the sophomore class is on
			    campus. In The Dartmouth’s survey, 90.1 of affiliated students said they
			    felt “very connected” or “somewhat connected” to social life and activity
			    on campus during sophomore summer, compared to the 52.5 percent of
			    unaffiliated students that said the same.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “[Sophomore summer] is definitely different because it can be pretty
			    Greek-centered – you have a lot of people living in their organizations, if
			    they’re affiliated, or living with friends off campus,” said Kane, adding
			    that there is a “different vibe.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    In the same survey, among sophomores, juniors and seniors, 76.4 percent of
			    unaffiliated and 58.2 percent of affiliated students agree that Dartmouth
			    needs more alternative spaces social spaces to Greek houses on campus. Of
			    the freshmen responses, 59.3 percent agree with the statement. One such
			    space that considers community a pillar of its foundation is the Collis
			    Center.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Collis Governing Board president Sean Cann ’17 said that he thinks Collis
			    provides a great alternative social space for students.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Cann added that the board has been intentionally focusing on weekly
			    programming this year, pointing out Microbrew Mondays and Trivia Tuesdays
			    as examples.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “It’s nice to have consistent events every week that people can show up to
			    and know they have a place there,” he said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Greek life at the College is not limited to one single narrative for the
			    whole student population, Welch said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “I think one of the best parts of our community here is that it means
			    something different to every person,” said Welch. “It’s about creating a
			    sense of unity, while trying your best not to make anyone feel excluded.”

			<h1> Dartmouth Faces Socioeconomic Divides Within Student Body </h1>
			<h3> By: Joyce Lee </h3>

			<p>
			    When it comes to identity, socioeconomic status can be the least visible
			    aspect of a student’s life, yet also the most tangible to the student
			    herself. At Dartmouth, the average student is likely to be more affluent
			    than the average college student. The recent findings from the Equality of
			    Opportunity Project revealed that at Dartmouth, the median family income is
			    $200,400 and 69 percent of the student population come from the top 20
			    percent of the national income distribution.
			</p>
			<p>
			    First Year Student Engagement Program director Jay Davis ’90 said that one
			    reason for the disparity between the proportion of students from low- and
			    high-income backgrounds is the difference in the quality of education
			    offered to students before they enter college. He said that this disparity
			    can be explained by a different awareness of post-secondary school
			    opportunities and the financial aid options that might exist at a school
			    such as Dartmouth. FYSEP is a mentorship program for first-generation
			    students in their first year at Dartmouth.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Schools like Dartmouth were more traditionally designed to meet the needs
			    of students who could afford that education,” Davis said. “It’s only more
			    recently in the history that these schools have made a commitment to
			    meeting financial aid needs.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Dartmouth is one of 38 colleges that partners with Questbridge, a national
			    nonprofit scholarship program that connects students from low-income
			    backgrounds to elite colleges. Questbridge student liaison Bethany Malzman
			    ’19 said that without Questbridge, she would not have been able to consider
			    applying to Dartmouth.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Alexis Castillo ’19 said that the Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth
			    scholarship program was instrumental in her college application process.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “I didn’t know what college was until the ninth grade,” she said. “I was
			    very frustrated going through the financial aid process, even with the help
			    of a mentor whom I was very lucky to have. My mom and I, for the longest
			    time, couldn’t figure out what one word meant and if it applied to us ...
			    It kept adding up. I felt like I had to go through the process on my own.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Castillo is also a first-generation student who is active in FYSEP, where
			    she said she has found most of her friends on campus.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “My friend group is of a similar socioeconomic status as myself,” Castillo
			    said. “I am also part of a Greek organization, but they are well aware of
			    the different socioeconomic backgrounds within [my co-ed fraternity], and
			    they try to be considerate of that.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Castillo added that she found people she spent time with at Dartmouth were
			    considerate or at least aware of the disparities resulting from
			    socioeconomic class.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Davis said that from his experience, first-generation students are excited
			    to know that there are other students from similar backgrounds as their own
			    and that programs such as FYSEP and the Office of Pluralism and
			    Leadership’s first-generation and low-income advising can provide a sense
			    of community to low-income students.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “The realization that there are others of similar backgrounds who are
			    succeeding — that’s important,” he said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    As a former Dartmouth student who came from a low-income background, Davis
			    said that there seemed to be a default assumption that most students were
			    well-off and were able to afford to travel back home, take vacations and
			    have access to disposable income.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “For students who do not [have this access], it can feel lonely,” Davis
			    said. “Socioeconomic status is more hidden than other markers of
			    diversity.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Victoria Corwin ’19 said that because her situation and her interests
			    derived from her background, she naturally gravitated towards programs such
			    as Dartmouth Quest for Socioeconomic Engagement.
			</p>
			<img src="images/Socioeconomic divide by Morgan Moinian.jpg" width = "550" height = "380" align = "left" hspace = "50" vspace = "50">
			<p>
			    “These kinds of communities [such as DQSE] bring themselves together
			    naturally,” she said. “Some students just have more time and more money to
			    do things that I wouldn’t normally do. They can afford to go to the
			    [Hopkins Center] every week and see famous people; meanwhile, all of my
			    friends are working, some of them say they don’t even have 10 dollars right
			    now. What you do socially depends on your socioeconomic status, and it
			    influences who you interact with.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Castillo said that she has often had conversations with her friends about
			    issues of balancing work and academics as well as extracurriculars. Other
			    issues, such as family financial needs, can also affect a student’s time on
			    campus, she said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Low-income students are more likely to have financial challenges at home,
			    which can make it difficult to focus on the academic challenges of
			    Dartmouth, Davis said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “There are many students at [the College] who are working jobs to send
			    money home to pay for family expenses,” he said. “And a student who is
			    working 35 hours a week to help pay for their family’s needs uses time
			    differently from a student who can focus time on their own needs.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Davis said that he is co-chairing a committee of staff and faculty called
			    Money Matters with Rachel Edens, the assistant dean and advisor to first
			    generation and low income students, to look specifically at the experience
			    of low-income students so as to reduce inequities with high-income
			    students.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Castillo said that certain actors in the Dartmouth community had to fight
			    for the resources that are now available to low-income students. Castillo
			    talked about her experience during spring interim, when all dining halls
			    were closed, and she was unable to afford eating out every day. Davis and
			    Edens, as well as 1vyG, a network of first-generation Ivy League students,
			    helped to make this situation known to the College, and students staying
			    over interim were provided with at least one meal a day by Dartmouth.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “There are resources I’m lucky to have, but we had to fight to get it —
			    Dartmouth wasn’t created for low income students,” Castillo said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Senior associate dean of student affairs Liz Agosto ’01 said that while the
			    College tries to mitigate economic circumstances and allow low-income
			    students to participate in core Dartmouth experiences, there remains a
			    discrepancy in their sense of belonging.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Such discrepancies can exist in terms of academics. Castillo said that her
			    socioeconomic background can affect her decision to take a class based on
			    the cost of textbooks.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Agosto said that Dartmouth has bright students who were not able to go
			    through a college-oriented high school experience. Putting students in
			    classes such as Writing 2-3 instead of Writing 5 and providing resources
			    like RWIT and free tutoring can help students achieve academic success, she
			    said. However, Agosto said that the very act of reaching out for help and
			    engaging with resources can be difficult if students were not
			    socioculturally prepared to express themselves in those ways.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “When we created FYSEP, it was less about teaching people to navigate
			    Dartmouth and more about accessing resources and asking for help,” she
			    said. “It’s less about ability and more about being taught to ask for help
			    and going to office hours. That creates a discrepancy in terms of access
			    that we continue to fight against.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Corwin said that many low-income students as well as first-generation
			    students may have no experience or idea of what an Ivy League college has
			    to offer. Figuring out financial aid and whether or not one can go abroad
			    were some difficulties a student may face, she said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Socioeconomic status blends a lot with first-generation [status] so that
			    can relate back to how people don’t know what they can do here,” she said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    The overlap of first-generation and low-income status can often lead to the
			    misconception that one means the other. Castillo said that not every
			    first-generation student is low income, and that Dartmouth’s definition of
			    a first-generation student is someone whose parents did not receive a
			    four-year college education in the United States.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “It can bring up an awkward conversation in the first-generation
			    community,” Castillo said. “[Members of the community] are mostly the same
			    socioeconomic status, but if there’s a first-generation student who doesn’t
			    share the same experience, it can be easily noted.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    While different identities can gain prominence at different parts of one’s
			    life, socioeconomic class can become a “great equalizer,” Agosto said,
			    because access to resources is a shared experience and it cuts across all
			    identities.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “But class can also exacerbate pressures or discriminations you already
			    feel as a woman or person of color or as a member of the LGBT+ community,”
			    she said. “It’s sometimes challenging to be a first-generation student
			    who’s not low-income because there are conflations of those identities that
			    aren’t accurate. It can be challenging to be white and low income because
			    of the conception that your skin color makes you privileged in a way that
			    you might not be.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    When it comes to discussion about class identity on campus, Corwin said
			    that she has often felt the topic pushed away during most social
			    interactions.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “I’ve only just realized that there’s so many people around me in different
			    situations,” Corwin said. “It’s not something that Dartmouth kids bring up
			    a lot. I don’t know if it’s because people assume everyone’s well off or
			    can at least afford to participate in Dartmouth activities the way they
			    can.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Malzman said that she thought it was important to have discussions about
			    socioeconomic status on campus and that such discussion would be helpful to
			    people who come from different backgrounds, especially in a space created
			    by a program like DQSE.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Agosto said that the creation of programs like FYSEP provides students with
			    the ability to talk about being first-generation and low-income so that
			    they feel that their identity is not something to be ashamed of. She said
			    that students who have resources should acknowledge that there are students
			    who are different.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “We have to find spaces to acknowledge why some students aren’t doing
			    certain things or how are we treating students who work at dining halls,”
			    Agosto said. “Some students who don’t work don’t acknowledge that there are
			    students who are working and also taking classes. There is a need to
			    recognize that your experience is not everyone else’s experience.”

			<h1> The Town and the College: An Interdependent Relationship </h1>
			<h3> Debora Hyemin Han </h3>
			<p>
			    The phrase “town and gown” refers to the relationship between an academic
			    institution and the city in which it exists but is often used to describe
			    disagreements or tensions that the two may have with one another. The town
			    and gown do not always fit together.
			</p>
			<img src="images/Main Street by Saphfire Brown.jpg" width = "550" height = "380" align = "left" hspace = "50" vspace = "50">
			<p>
			    For many of Hanover’s leaders, however, the town and gown do seem to
			    complement one another — and quite well. The phrase has evolved to
			    represent a symbiotic and inextricable relationship between the College and
			    Hanover. Town manager Julia Griffin said that the strong history of this
			    relationship, and the challenge of maintaining it, is what attracted her to
			    the position almost two decades ago.
			</p>
			<p>
			    The evolution of small businesses on Main Street provides a window into
			    this long-lasting relationship. Patti Fried, a co-owner of Lou’s Restaurant
			    since 1992, said that because Lou’s has been in Hanover for so many years,
			    and because so many Dartmouth community members have come through the
			    restaurant, the best word to describe the relationship is “nostalgia.” The
			    staff at Lou’s conscientiously maintains a balance between new and old
			    aspects of the diner because of how large of a role it plays in Dartmouth
			    students’ experiences, making sure to “keep up the trends for the new
			    kids,” but not changing too much for the older alumni who come to visit,
			    Fried added.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Established in 1947, Lou’s had been originally been a 24-hour business,
			    running as a diner in the mornings and then transforming into a Mexican
			    restaurant at night. When Lou’s decided to stop running as a 24-hour
			    business and focus on breakfast and brunch, it did so to “focus on the
			    students,” according to Fried. The eatery often bases its menu options
			    based on what students prefer and request. When making recipes, Lou’s
			    kitchen is conscientious of its ingredients, because it wants to provide
			    healthy options to students and because Lou’s staff enjoy “nurturing the
			    students with food,” as Fried says.
			</p>
			<p>
			    This nurturing relationship with students is something the townspeople have
			    developed over the years as well, most recently coming to light when the
			    Donald Trump administration promised new policies on immigration and the
			    status of immigrants and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals students on
			    campus were questioned.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “When the DACA student issue hit the newspapers, I can’t tell you the
			    number of people in our community who emailed me to say if those students
			    ever need a safe house to live in, if the federal government cracks down on
			    the DACA students, I’m volunteering two bedrooms in my house if they need
			    it,” Griffith said. “Port in a storm.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Many townspeople, according to Griffin, have a lot of affection for
			    students, and part of the reason they choose to live in a college town is
			    because of the students. Victoria Simek, a new co-owner of Morano Gelato,
			    said that the students’ vibe, energy and diversity “bring a lot to the
			    town” and make it as vibrant as it is.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Because the students are such a prominent part of the community, however,
			    there are some aspects that cause concern, especially student drinking.
			    Griffin said that throughout her time as town manager, she has seen the
			    level of drinking among Dartmouth students increase “markedly,” including
			    the instances of students drinking until they “blackout.” This troubles
			    some Hanover residents, because they worry for both students’ well-being
			    and their children’s impressions of Dartmouth students. Griffin says
			    townspeople she has come in contact with speak about how children see
			    heavily intoxicated Dartmouth students and wonder why they are in the state
			    they are in. Students, she says, are on display “for better or for worse,”
			    and their choices, recreational and otherwise, impact others in the
			    community.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Our kids who are growing up in this community are seeing student behavior
			    at its finest and student behavior at its lowest,” she said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    According to Hanover Police Chief Charlie Dennis, drinking and disturbances
			    caused by parties are also two main reasons for the police’s involvement
			    with students, in addition to theft. The relationship between students and
			    the police department in regards to drinking has actually improved over the
			    years, according to Dennis, as students are no longer automatically cited
			    when they are sent to Dick’s House for drinking-related issues as they once
			    were before the change was made in 2015. Dennis said this practice of
			    “projecting ourselves in the middle of the medical process,” which was in
			    place when he arrived to the position, was not perceived well internally or
			    externally, leading to the changes.
			</p>
			<p>
			    One of Dennis’ other concerns regarding students and the Hanover community
			    is pedestrian safety around campus, in terms of jaywalking and looking at
			    cellphones while walking in the streets. Jim Kenyon, a Norwich resident and
			    columnist at the Valley News, identifies this issue as one of the “special
			    challenges” that comes with living in a college town.
			</p>
			<p>
			    This neighborly aspect to Dartmouth’s relationship with Hanover is not
			    restricted to students — in fact, it becomes extremely relevant in the
			    College’s plans for expanding infrastructure and building new facilities,
			    especially when those plans are close to residents’ property. Griffin said
			    one of the first things she did as town manager was tighten the planning
			    and zoning processes of the town, which she said were a bit loose. These
			    processes present a tension within the Dartmouth-Hanover relationship.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “The biggest challenge we have in the town is when the College is
			    developing new facilities on the periphery of the campus that abut a
			    residential neighborhood,” she said. “Inevitably, abutters to that project
			    are often concerned about growth and development happening right on the
			    edge of the campus.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Recently, the Hanover planning board did not approve the College’s proposed
			    indoor practice facility. The building, which was to be located near Tyler
			    Road, was denied planning permission in a four-to-one vote. The College is
			    now appealing that decision at the Grafton County Superior Court on the
			    basis that the project complied with the zoning ordinance and town
			    regulations and that the planning board did not have the authority to deny
			    the project, according to Griffin.
			</p>
			<p>
			    According to Griffin, the proposed rezoning of West Wheelock Street two
			    years ago provoked controversy. She said that this project would have
			    enabled the College to do additional construction on the north side of the
			    street and replace old housing along West Wheelock with new housing that
			    would be denser in terms of the residential units that could be constructed
			    in a given space.
			</p>
			<p>
			    This motion initially failed at a town meeting because neighbors on the
			    south side of West Wheelock Street were concerned about growth and
			    development, Griffin said. However, it passed last year to build a new
			    parking facility into the hillside below Thayer School of Engineering as a
			    “much more scaled back version of the proposal that had failed the year
			    before.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    According to Griffin, balancing the College’s growth with the understanding
			    of neighbors’ interests in this densely-settled town is crucial to
			    maintaining a healthy relationship with the town and its residents. She
			    said this balance is necessary in any community that hosts a large
			    institution, whether it is a college, a federal or state government
			    facility or a large manufacturer. Hanover’s director of planning, zoning
			    and codes Robert Houseman said that from a town regulatory perspective,
			    maintaining a level playing field for all applicants, including Dartmouth
			    College, is “essential to [the board’s] process.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    At the same time, however, Dartmouth’s new buildings offer perks for the
			    residents who can use those facilities. Dartmouth has collaborated with the
			    town in joint-ventures that have been immensely beneficial to the community
			    — projects that the town would probably not have been able to afford
			    otherwise, according to Griffin.
			</p>
			<p>
			    For example, Griffin recalled when the community decided it was time to
			    renovate Hanover High School and build a new middle school. The cost was
			    $42 million, which would have been “a pretty exorbitant cost impact” for
			    Hanover and Norwich residents, according to Griffin. The Hanover select
			    board approached then-Dartmouth president Jim Wright and Dartmouth to fund
			    a little over $9 million of that cost. Knowing that improving the high
			    school and middle school facility was an important community asset that had
			    some value for faculty and staff at Dartmouth, as well as newly recruited
			    faculty and administration who were looking to relocate, the College agreed
			    to help subsidize $9.2 million for the project. The College also paid
			    $50,000 for a new boat for the Connecticut River for the fire department to
			    use in emergencies, Griffin added.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Now, the College works with the town to plan joint cultural activities,
			    facilitate events that happen on Dartmouth’s campus which the community
			    also takes part in and collaborate on infrastructure projects, Griffin
			    said. Such projects include rebuilding sidewalks, building a new bus
			    shelter, burying utilities underground and switching street lights over to
			    LEDs.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Dartmouth also directly contributes to Hanover infrastructure through tax
			    contributions. This tax relationship means that Dartmouth, as a private
			    college, pays property taxes on dorms and dining halls, making Dartmouth
			    the largest taxpayer in Hanover, paying $7 million in dining halls and
			    residence halls taxes alone, according to Griffin. The tax revenue goes
			    towards the general fund operating budget for the town, which includes the
			    operations of the public works department, police department, parks and
			    recreation, planning and zoning, administrative debts and the two local
			    libraries. In addition to this, Dartmouth pays a fire tax, a water tax and
			    wastewater fees that go towards the water treatment facility, the water
			    distribution system, the sewer collection system and sewer treatment
			    facility, Griffin said. These taxes allow the town to do “a lot of things
			    that your average community that hosts a state university in New Hampshire
			    can’t do,” she said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “I am sure that there are always people who think the College should be
			    doing more than [it’s] doing, but a lot of our residents simply don’t have
			    a really detailed sense of all that the College is doing in part because
			    the College doesn’t blow its own horn about those things,” she said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    However, the problems that the College does have are under scrutiny by the
			    community, such as the issues with Rennie Farm. The College was recently
			    accused of contaminating the land of Hanover residents by burying animal
			    remains that had been used for medical research at Rennie Farm in the 1960s
			    and 1970s. Kenyon says the community is “waiting to see what Dartmouth
			    does” in regards to this issue.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “[Dartmouth executive vice president] Rick Mills has talked about that —
			    that they’re going to make it right — so people are just are very
			    interested to see how the College defines that,” he said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    After Kenyon spoke with The Dartmouth, on Feb. 6 the College agreed to
			    compensate homeowners for any losses they may experience in the housing
			    market that are caused by the contamination.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Kenyon said that Dartmouth is a corporation and that its nature as a
			    business often impacts the way it deals with issues like Rennie Farm and
			    the rest of the community.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “People think that higher education is about is a philanthropic operation,”
			    he said. “Those days are long over. So the important thing is for people to
			    remember that Dartmouth is a business and they operate like a business.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    He and Griffin both point out that Dartmouth once had a community relations
			    officer who was in charge of managing relations and issues with the town,
			    but that position is no longer in place. Griffin said it would be helpful
			    to have a person with a similar role whose job it is to “keep their ear to
			    the ground and take the pulse of the community” to maintain College-town
			    relations. However, College spokesperson Diana Lawrence wrote in an email
			    statement that Heather Drinan, an associate director in the office of the
			    Vice Provost for Research, takes care of many aspects of community
			    relations such as responding to community concerns, securing public grants,
			    attending community meetings and meeting with public officials. Lawrence
			    added that community relations are also handled by the College’s Real
			    Estate Office, the Provost’s Office and the President’s office.
			</p>
			<p>
			    The College’s responsibility to actively maintain this relationship with
			    Hanover, and divert resources to do this, is one of its competing
			    priorities, according to Griffin. She acknowledged that the town cannot
			    expect the College to use its money to better the town, and that the
			    College’s mission is not to improve the town, but to educate their
			    students. However, she believes that the more the College dedicates to the
			    town, the more will be returned back to the students and the College
			    community.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “It’s a balancing act, and I recognize that,” she said. “But I know as a
			    municipal manager that there are all sorts of ways that we take care of our
			    residents and that is so appreciated by our residents. It comes back to us
			    tenfold in terms of positive impacts on the relationship that the town has
			    with its constituents, and so I think it behooves the College to continue
			    to stay focused on what they can do to support the community.”

			<h1> International Students Search for Community </h1>
			<h3> By: Mika Jehoon Lee </h3>
			<p>
			    Comprising 8.9 percent of the College’s undergraduate population,
			    international students at Dartmouth represent more than 70 countries around
			    the world. This group includes a future anthropology major from Bulgaria, a
			    water polo enthusiast from Hong Kong and an aspiring South Korean doctor
			    who sings semi-professionally in her leisure time. Not only do
			    international students here have diverse cultural backgrounds and
			    interests, but they also share different ideas about what it means to be an
			    international student on this campus.
			</p>

			<p>
			    When Ray Guo ’19 first arrived at Dartmouth from Beijing, China,
			    identifying as an international student was an unfamiliar feeling, he said.
			    Over the past 18 years of his life, he said he had always identified as a
			    Chinese student. However, the moment Guo landed in the United States, he
			    acquired a second cultural identity, which he described as “broad but
			    ambiguous.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    “I think the definition of an international student is just imposed upon us
			    when we get to the U.S.,” Guo said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    According to Guo, the diversity of nationalities and cultures represented
			    by the College’s international students makes it difficult for the entire
			    international community at Dartmouth to be tight-knit.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “The only common thing that [international students] share is that we are
			    just international and not U.S. citizens, so it doesn’t really make
			    [international students] tight,” Guo said. “Within the international
			    community, there are sub-communities that are really close like the Korean,
			    the Chinese or the Latin American student communities.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Taiwanese and Canadian dual citizen Herbert Chang ’18 explained why certain
			    cultural groups on campus tend to be more closely knit than others.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “For one, people definitely feel the most comfortable with people that they
			    are familiar with and who have experienced similar situations,” Chang said.
			    “In that regard, a lot of my best friends are from Asia.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    From Jan. 22 to Jan. 29, The Dartmouth administered a campus-wide online
			    survey of student attitudes toward different communities on campus, which
			    garnered 532 responses. In this survey, 64.5 percent of respondents said
			    that international students are “very integrated” or “somewhat integrated”
			    in the general student body population at the College, while 26.4 percent
			    of respondents said that international students are “not very integrated”
			    or “not integrated at all.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    The percentage of international students in Dartmouth’s Class of 2020 is
			    lower compared to that of other Ivy League institutions. International
			    students comprise over 10 percent of most Ivy League schools’ freshman
			    classes, but only eight percent of Dartmouth’s Class of 2020.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Many international students said that various programs organized by the
			    Office of Pluralism and Leadership at the beginning of the year
			    significantly helped them get to know each other and adjust to the new
			    environment.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Four days before New Student Orientation, OPAL hosts the International
			    Student Orientation. During this program, international students receive
			    information about their responsibilities under the F-1 visa, go on shopping
			    trips to West Lebanon and socialize with their peers.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Holly Sung ’20, an international student from the Czech Republic, said that
			    she especially appreciated ISO’s social events because they had a
			    substantial impact on connecting her to her peers.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Social events such as the welcome barbecue helped me get to know a lot of
			    international students,” Sung said. “Most of us had never come to the U.S.
			    before, so we could relate to one another more easily.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Many of the relationships that international students built during ISO last
			    even after the program ends, according to Egyptian-American student Jebreel
			    Samples ’19, who grew up in Qatar. A few of Samples’ close friends at
			    Dartmouth are the people that he first met during the program, he said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Besides the social interactions that take place throughout ISO, Tony
			    Kirumba ’19, whose home is in Nairobi, Kenya, said that he mostly valued
			    the sessions that discussed academics and residential life.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “By the time the New Student Orientation started, I felt pretty well
			    situated,” Kirumba said. “I would say 80 percent of the time that I spent
			    in [ISO] sessions was really valuable.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    He added that these sessions helped him better understand classes, life at
			    Dartmouth, work and other logistics.
			</p>
			<p>
			    In addition to ISO, OPAL also coordinates the International Friendship
			    Family Program, as well as the International Student Mentor Program.
			</p>
			<p>
			    The FFP matches international undergraduates with local families in the
			    Upper Valley. Throughout the year, “friendship families” invite students to
			    dinners, family outings and holiday celebrations. According to Chang, who
			    is the FFP student coordinator, 90 to 120 students sign up every year.
			    Chang also said that during the matching process, the FFP tries to group
			    together students and families with similar interests.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Bulgarian student Veselin Nanov ’20 said that the FFP has provided him with
			    a positive cultural experience so far.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “I am a prospective anthropology major, and I got matched with an
			    anthropology professor,” Nanov said. “In the beginning of the year, during
			    a family picnic, I met his entire family and we ate lunch.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    He added that the picnic was the highlight of the program for him.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Participants in the International Student Mentorship Program are assigned
			    to upper-class Dartmouth students who are known as International Student
			    Mentors. Mentors are responsible for assisting their freshmen mentees
			    during their transition to Dartmouth for the fall and winter terms.
			</p>
			<p>
			    When Shirley Zhang ’19 landed in Boston Logan International Airport after a
			    long flight from Chengdu, China, she was met by mentors who
			    enthusiastically greeted her, she said. According to Zhang, the warm
			    welcome she received lessened her anxiety and motivated her to apply to
			    become a mentor her sophomore year.
			</p>
			<p>
			    South Korean student Kyoung Tae Kim ’20 said that while he valued the
			    support he received from his mentor, the temporary nature of the program
			    led to infrequent contact as the school year progressed.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “At first, I think the program is helpful because I have someone to ask
			    questions to,” Kim said. “These days, I only occasionally talk to my mentor
			    because there isn’t any scheduled programming for mentors and mentees.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Despite the different programs that OPAL organizes every year,
			    international students at Dartmouth have undergone various challenges as
			    they tried to settle in the new environment. Students like Guo and Nanov
			    experienced culture shock when they arrived, they said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Even if we have a lot of friends, when we exchange ideas, we are not
			    really on the same page due to the difference in our past experiences and
			    system of values,” Guo said. “It is sometimes hard to find someone who
			    really understands you.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Nanov added that the disparity between his expectations of Dartmouth and
			    what he witnessed in reality was disappointing.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “I was unaccustomed to the ‘frat’ culture and found it challenging to
			    accept that it is the primary way to spend leisure time,” he said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    According to Nanov, he was impressed by the number of academic lectures and
			    events the College coordinates but was also disappointed with the
			    consistently low student turnout.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “So few students attend the lectures held by the humanities speakers or
			    [Hopkins Center] events,” Nanov said. “That is not what I had expected
			    coming to a school with a reputation that Dartmouth has.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Samples, who grew up in cities with large international populations, said
			    he believed the College’s rural setting and its relative lack of
			    international students made his adjustment to Dartmouth more difficult.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “[In a city], you have opportunities to be with and go to a community group
			    and find other people from your background or other people from stories
			    similar to yours,” Samples said. “It is difficult [at Dartmouth] since
			    there aren’t many international students.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Meanwhile, Kirumba said his adjustment phase was much smoother because he
			    had family members living in the United States.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Something I am thankful for is the feeling of home here,” he said. “When
			    everyone leaves for ‘winterim’ to spend Thanksgiving with their families, I
			    can do that here — I know that’s not the case with some of my
			    [international] friends.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    One issue that international students said they believe will pose a
			    challenge for the College’s future international community is the recent
			    end of need-blind admission for international applicants. Starting with the
			    Class of 2020, the financial need of international applicants was factored
			    into admission decisions.
			</p>
			<p>
			    In an article published in The Dartmouth on Jan. 27, 2016 that focused on
			    the application pool for the Class of 2020, director of admissions Paul
			    Sunde wrote in an email that the number of applications from international
			    students has either stayed constant or increased. However, many
			    international students expressed concerns about the impact that this policy
			    change will have on the international community.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “When the information [about the need-aware policy] came down, there was a
			    lot of outrage — why was this decision being made, did they think about how
			    this was going to affect people applying to Dartmouth because it’s an
			    important part of their decision to come and that this opportunity is not
			    going to leave us in crazy debt,” Kirumba said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Guo said that this issue had a positive influence in bringing members of
			    the international community together.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “The change in financial aid is the only issue that I could think of that
			    binds the international community together and sheds some light on our
			    identity as international students because we are fighting for the common
			    cause,” Guo said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    According to Zhang, the College’s change to need-aware admissions
			    illustrates its under-appreciation of international students.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “I think the College should focus on actually accepting more international
			    students and not take financial aid away,” Zhang said. “I don’t think we
			    are valued as much as international students in other institutions —
			    [Dartmouth’s] actions don’t reflect how much they value us.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Nanov said he also thinks that the current political climate has posed
			    challenges to international students in all U.S. higher-education
			    institutions.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “I feel like especially in light of the executive action on immigration
			    signed by the president, the international community throughout all U.S.
			    institutions have been affected,” Nanov said. “I think it’s important for
			    the College and other students to realize that it’s a great challenge to
			    come to the U.S. from abroad, so I would appreciate the support from other
			    students on campus and the College administration.”

			<h1> Graduate Schools Help Organize Student Social Life </h1>
			<h3> By: Megan Clyne </h3>
			<p>
			    When people think of community at the College, they often limit themselves
			    to the scope of the undergraduate population. However, graduate students at
			    Dartmouth also learn together, study together and have fun together. Thayer
			    School of Engineering, Tuck School of Business and Geisel School of
			    Medicine are also characterized by a strong community spirit.
			</p>
			<img src="images/Tuck dining by Saphfire Brown.jpg" width = "550" height = "380" align = "left" hspace = "50" vspace = "50">
			<p>
			    Several student-led organizations support communities in the graduate
			    schools. The Thayer Council is the student council for Dartmouth
			    engineering students while the MEM Student Council serves those engineering
			    students working towards a Master of Engineering Management degree.
			    First-year Thayer Ph.D. student and Thayer Council co-president Amogha
			    Tadimety and MEM Student Council president Joey Rabinovitch Th ’18 attested
			    to Thayer’s close-knit community.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Thayer plans various social endeavors as opportunities for the students to
			    get to know one another better outside of the classroom, Tadimety said.
			    These events include a Homecoming barbecue, a sailing event at Mascoma Lake
			    and an annual January formal. Rabinovitch added that there is a “Friday
			    Beers” event for Thayer students, faculty and staff every week. There are
			    also frequent movie nights in the Thayer auditorium and evenings of dinner,
			    dancing and live music, Rabinovitch said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Tadimety said that these events have proven to be informal, natural ways in
			    which students can socialize. Her experience at Thayer has emphasized to
			    her the importance of forging bonds with students and faculty alike. Social
			    opportunities organized by Thayer are especially appreciated by students
			    who may live off campus and do not have the direct capacity to get to know
			    other students better, Rabinovitch said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Now that I’m here, I’ve realized how important community is, especially at
			    Dartmouth,” Tadimety said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Rabinovitch said that he was in awe of the diversity at Thayer. The
			    different perspectives in terms of academics and nationality help students
			    work with one another, he said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    According to Geisel’s assistant to the associate dean for student affairs
			    Tina Hoisington, Geisel plans an event called “Oh, the places you’ll go!”
			    in which third and fourth-year medical students meet first and second year
			    students at a local restaurant. There, students further along in their
			    medical school experience talk with younger students about all the
			    experiences ahead of them and answer any questions they may have,
			    Hoisington said. She added that semi-formals and formals are great
			    platforms for students at Geisel to reconnect with other medical students
			    as well as students from the other graduate schools, especially given the
			    frequent travel schedule of third and fourth year students. The
			    semi-formals and formals are always well attended, she added.
			</p>
			<p>
			    At Geisel, students have the opportunity and are encouraged to constantly
			    collaborate with the larger community and amongst themselves, Hoisington
			    said. Each week, two to three students travel with a faculty member to do
			    community service with organizations like the Good Neighbor Clinic, the
			    Haven, the Claremont soup kitchen, the Manchester Sununu Program, David’s
			    House and the Mascoma Clinic. Hoisington also said that Geisel hosts a
			    community service day in which the school provide services such as free
			    blood pressure checks and hand sanitizer to the greater community.
			</p>
			<img src="images/Tuck dining 2 by Saphfire Brown.jpg" width = "550" height = "380" align = "left" hspace = "50" vspace = "50">
			<p>
			    Tuck has a profound sense of community, said Laura Shen Tu’17 and Sally
			    Jaeger, assistant dean and director of the MBA Program at Tuck.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “The sense of community leads to a transformative experience from the
			    moment you walk on campus to the moment you graduate,” Shen said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Shen said that the residential experience of first-year students grants
			    them the opportunity to learn, study and form connections with one another.
			    More than half of first-year Tuck students live on campus. Since this
			    community is one that supports students, Shen said that students feel
			    comfortable in taking risks. The diverse group of students with different
			    types of experiences also leads to a unique community spirit, Shen said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Jaeger added that students choose to come to Tuck because they want to be
			    part of a community. There are a variety of programs that integrate Tuck
			    into the other graduate schools, including the MEM MBA program between Tuck
			    and Thayer, Jaeger said. There are also social events like the Suits and
			    Stethoscopes party thrown annually in order to foster relationship building
			    between Tuck and Geisel students.
			</p>
			<p>
			    In terms of connections to undergraduate students at Thayer, Tadimety said
			    that she does not see significant interaction beyond professional outreach
			    in the laboratory, where graduate students interact with and support
			    undergraduate students. Rabinovitch agreed, adding that Thayer students are
			    primarily interested in developing friendships with their fellow
			    classmates. The one main exception would be the graduate students who
			    participate in the residential fellows program at the College, Rabinovitch
			    said. The residential fellows program places graduate students in each of
			    the undergraduate housing communities and is designed to integrate
			    undergraduate and graduate students through activities like mentoring,
			    tutoring and dinners.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Hoisington said that because Geisel’s schedule differs fundamentally from
			    the undergraduate student schedule, it is difficult to establish
			    connections between undergraduates and the medical school. Geisel students
			    are also encouraged to participate in undergraduate events such as the
			    polar bear plunge during Winter Carnival, Hoisington said. Interim dean of
			    Geisel Duane Compton wrote in an email that there are many opportunities
			    for undergraduate students to explore medicine at Geisel, especially the
			    shadowing program in which students follow physicians and learn more about
			    various medical fields and professions.
			</p>
			<p>
			    The relationship between Tuck and the College has only grown over the
			    years, Jaeger said. Tuck faculty members teach three courses for
			    undergraduate students, Tuck students in the Women in Business club mentor
			    student-athletes, the Tuck Bridge program exposes undergraduate students to
			    the methods and knowledge of business and Tuck partners with the
			    Rockefeller Center to provide internships to a group of Dartmouth students
			    through the Paganucci program.

			<h1> Living Learning Communities Offer New Options to Students </h1>
			<h3> By: Betty Kim </h3>
			<img src="images/DSC_3506.jpg" width = "550" height = "380" align = "left" hspace = "50" vspace = "50">
			<p>
			    Though students often make friends through different classes, clubs, sports
			    teams and performance groups, one common place students tend to form
			    long-term relationships is on their floor or in their building. Living
			    Learning Communities take that idea to the next level by housing people
			    together who have similar interests and want to integrate them into their
			    daily lives.
			</p>
			<p>
			    In an online survey with 532 student respondents by The Dartmouth, among
			    students who have lived or currently live in an LLC, 66.2 percent said that
			    LLCs have had a positive impact on their Dartmouth experience, 25.5 percent
			    reported no impact and 4.5 percent said there was a negative impact. The
			    numbers correlate to a variety of factors, some well-known by all Dartmouth
			    students while others are not as visible to students outside of the LLCs.
			</p>
			<p>
			    According to Healthcare Policy, Innovation and Delivery LLC Student
			    Coordinator Nathan Busam ’17, a student’s level of engagement with the LLC
			    depends in part on how involved they choose to be in the LLC’s activities
			    and events.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Some students are very engaged, and they come to all the events; other
			    students are too busy, or they just kind of live there,” Busam said.
			</p>
			<img src="images/McLaughlin bullitin board by Lauren Kim.jpg" width = "550" height = "380" align = "left" hspace = "50" vspace = "50">
			<p>
			    Though the application process highlights the benefits revolving around
			    living in a community based on identity and intellectual discourse, housing
			    benefits seem to be a factor just as significant in a student’s choice for
			    living in the LLCs. In The Dartmouth’s survey, 39.6 percent of students
			    reported housing benefits as their primary reason for choosing to live in
			    an LLC. Only 7.5 percent chose programming as their primary reason, and
			    49.2 percent chose both.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Regardless of the reason for a student’s interest in an LLC, however,
			    programming within each community is diverse and provides several benefits
			    to students both affiliated and unaffiliated with the LLCs.
			</p>
			<p>
			    One such benefit that several LLC residents and leaders emphasized was the
			    way in which LLCs are spaces accepting of religious, cultural or gender and
			    sexuality-related identities that might not otherwise be acknowledged.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Leah Torrey, Tucker Center multi-faith advisor and staff advisor of the
			    Interfaith LLC, said that the Interfaith LLC often operates as a “safe
			    space” for students who feel that their religious identity is not welcomed
			    in everyday conversation.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “[Religious people] can easily be themselves on the Interfaith floor, so
			    it’s not uncommon for religious minorities to find this floor and stay on
			    this floor,” Torrey said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Whether students are religious, agnostic or atheist, the LLC requires all
			    students to have one hour of “religious or moral conversation” per week,
			    either at the floor’s weekly Sunday dinner or Tucker’s Multifaith
			    Conversations on Tuesday nights. Students must also attend one alternative
			    religious service per term and are assigned a roommate with different
			    religious views than theirs.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Rafa Rosas ’20 also described Triangle House as a safe space for “LGBTQIA+”
			    students. According to Rosas, half of the programming by Triangle House has
			    to do with social activism, and the other half has to do with important
			    issues such as mental, physical and sexual health. Members will be pursuing
			    a project this spring term coding data related to research about sexual
			    assault prevention.
			</p>
			<p>
			    International students and students of color can also find a home in the
			    McLaughlin Cluster. According to Makisa Bronson ’20, a member of the Great
			    Issues Scholars LLC, the Global Village cluster and LLCs in general create
			    a space for students to feel “appreciated and included.” The Great Issues
			    Scholars LLC is part of the Global Village.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Since we all have such diverse experiences and come from entirely
			    different backgrounds, I’ve felt that these are some of the most complex
			    and rewarding friendships that I’ve been able to have so far in my life,”
			    Bronson said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Bronson observed that this welcoming environment is not only created by
			    racial diversity but also centered on the common interests of members, who
			    are all dedicated to learning about and educating themselves on issues of
			    global importance.
			</p>
			<p>
			    In The Dartmouth’s survey, 40.8 percent of non-white students said that
			    LLCs had a positive impact on their time at Dartmouth, while only 22.1
			    percent of white students said the same.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Also in the Global Village LLC cluster is the Japanese Language Program,
			    which is a community centered around integrating education about Japanese
			    language and culture into dorm living. Emily Grabowski ’18, who has been
			    both a member and undergraduate advisor in the program, said that it is
			    designed to help students of different proficiency levels improve their
			    knowledge of Japan. Though students are encouraged to practice speaking
			    Japanese as much as possible, there is no strict rule regarding the usage
			    of English.
			</p>
			<img src="images/McLaughlin cluster by Lauren Kim.jpg" width = "550" height = "380" align = "left" hspace = "50" vspace = "50">
			<p>
			    “Not having a strict language requirement really makes it a more inclusive
			    environment so people who don’t have as strong a language skill can still
			    feel included,” Grabowski said. “I think that’s really important for the
			    community building aspect.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    According to faculty advisor James Dorsey, events for Japanese Language
			    Program students include the “3 F’s,” or “Food and Film with Faculty,”
			    where a faculty member picks a movie to watch over dinner with students and
			    leads a discussion afterwards. Members also attend student-centered events,
			    like cooking Japanese food and singing karaoke.
			</p>
			<p>
			    The Chinese Language House, a standalone LLC on North Main Street, provides
			    a similar experience for students who want to improve their fluency in
			    Chinese language and culture. According to Chinese Language House member
			    Catherine Conway ’17, the learning experience may be more valuable for
			    students advanced enough to speak outside of a classroom setting, but
			    advanced speakers do help less-experienced members.
			</p>
			<p>
			    According to Conway, Chinese Language House members commit to eating dinner

			    Many LLCs are only a few years old, and LLC administrators and residents
			    expressed ideas for change and excitement about future developments.
			</p>
			<p>
			    The LLC system continues to evolve with the possibilities of the “Design
			    Your Own Community” LLC initiative. Both the Healthcare Policy, Innovation
			    and Delivery LLC and the Thought Project LLC are student-designed.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Busam said that coordinating events for his LLC would be easier with more
			    support from the administration in terms of dealing with logistics and
			    securing funding for events. More communication between administrators and
			    LLCs, as well as clarification on which administrator to reach out to for a
			    specific project, would be helpful, Busam added. Torrey also said that she
			    felt there was some ambiguity regarding who to contact and what kind of
			    requests were reasonable to make.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Torrey also brought up how LLCs can be integrated into the new house
			    community system. Certain LLCs are trying to foster a larger sense of
			    general community among the houses by having joint events with other LLCs.
			</p>
			<p>
			    The Interfaith LLC, for example, has collaborated with the Thought Project
			    LLC by hosting an event in which environmental studies and writing
			    professor Terry Osborne shared a spiritual autobiography “in secular terms”
			    in Occom Commons, Torrey said. According to Busam, the Healthcare Policy,
			    Innovation and Delivery LLC has also had very similar speakers to the
			    Thought Project and is attempting to collaborate in the future with the
			    Thought Project.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Recently, a barbecue and winter outdoors activity event was hosted for all
			    LLC students. By aiming for an “LLC identity,” the program helps make
			    students feel included even if they might feel excluded from the housing
			    system, Conway said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Rosas, however, expressed a desire for his LLC to be more connected with
			    the rest of the school. Though non-LGBTQ identifying students are welcome
			    in Triangle House, only residents have access to the building.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “I understand the necessity for a space safe, but it would be really nice
			    to have [Triangle House] open for set time frames where it’s open to the
			    broader community,” Rosas said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Rosas expressed his appreciation for Queer Family Dinners, which are events
			    held in Triangle House by Spectra, a club for queer and allied students at
			    Dartmouth.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Triangle House is huge [in terms of size] for the amount of people that
			    live in it, [so] it always makes me sad that not more things happen there
			    because it has the potential to be such an amazing space,” Rosas said. He
			    also said that he hopes more events will be held at Triangle House,
			    especially as Spectra grows.

			<h1> Faculty and Staff Evaluate the Community at Dartmouth </h1>
			<h3> By: Julian Nathan </h3>
			<p>
			    Dartmouth’s commitment to fostering a supportive community is highlighted
			    prominently on the College’s website and in its marketing materials.
			    However, faculty and staff at the College have differing opinions on
			    whether Dartmouth has succeeded in its efforts to create the inclusive
			    community it promotes and publicizes. Some of the new changes implemented
			    by the Moving Dartmouth Forward initiative, such as the house communities
			    and an increased focus on academic rigor, seem to be having an effect on
			    the sense of community felt on campus.
			</p>
			<img src="images/house communities 1 by Paula Kutschera.jpg" width = "550" height = "380" align = "left" hspace = "50" vspace = "50">
			<p>
			    Peter Marsh of facilities, operations &amp; management, who has spent over
			    30 years working at Dartmouth and is a former trustee for Dartmouth’s
			    branch of the Service Employees International Union, said that he has
			    observed some negative changes in Dartmouth’s community atmosphere over the
			    years.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Marsh explained that students seem to be more academically stressed than
			    ever before. He added that students’ increased focus on academics might
			    have come at the expense of long-standing Dartmouth traditions. Among the
			    traditions he said that Dartmouth has lost is the construction of snow
			    sculptures during Winter Carnival.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Marsh, who grew up in Hanover, recounted a time decades ago when students
			    built snow sculptures “everywhere.” He added that now, it seems that
			    students are too busy to build any snow sculptures at all. On Jan. 13, a
			    campus-wide email announcement from the Winter Carnival Council explained
			    that “many years of declining involvement from the student body” led the
			    Council to focus its efforts on other Winter Carnival events. The Council
			    also listed decreasing snowfall and an absence of student leadership as
			    reasons for its decision.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Marsh remarked that over the years, campus-wide enthusiasm about events
			    like Homecoming seems to have gradually decreased.
			</p>
			<p>
			    The loss of these traditions could be tied to a larger change in
			    Dartmouth’s community atmosphere as a whole, he said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Marsh also said that, in the last decade, a strain of elitism has pervaded
			    campus. He said that this elitism was not entirely contained within the
			    student body. On some occasions, Marsh said he has felt as though Dartmouth
			    community members have treated him as “the help.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    He also said that over the years, political correctness has stifled free
			    speech and open discussion on campus. According to Marsh, students used to
			    be more receptive towards more conservative publications like The Dartmouth
			    Review.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Students do not want to read anything that they do not agree with, he
			    added.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Still, on the whole, community at Dartmouth is more of a positive factor
			    than a negative one, Marsh said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Physics professor Ryan Hickox, who is also West House’s house professor,
			    said he has not noticed any negative trends in student behavior towards
			    each other, faculty and staff during the six years he has worked at the
			    College. While there are some isolated instances where students are
			    disrespectful towards others, these incidents appear to have become less
			    common throughout his time at Dartmouth, he added.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Dartmouth Dining Services supervisor Gordon Wright said that he has not
			    noticed any trends related to elitism or increased academic stress on
			    campus.
			</p>
			<p>
			    He characterized all of the interactions that he has had with students
			    during his seven-year tenure at DDS as positive, noting that he becomes
			    especially familiar with athletic teams that frequent the Class of 1953
			    Commons.
			</p>

			<p>
			    He added that most of the interactions he has witnessed occurring between
			    students have been positive.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Hickox said that house communities might further strengthen the College’s
			    campus community as future classes become more involved in the programming.
			    He said that house communities could facilitate “genuine interactions among
			    diverse groups of people.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    House communities also facilitate interactions between faculty members who
			    might otherwise not have ever crossed paths, he said.
			</p>
			<img src="images/house communities 2 by Paula Kutschera.jpg" width = "550" height = "380" align = "left" hspace = "50" vspace = "50">
			<p>
			    “Our house communities provide an opportunity for faculty members in
			    different departments to get together in a purely social environment,”
			    Hickox added.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Wright also said that DDS’ policy of providing faculty members with
			    discounted prices, as well as the Paganucci Lounge, which provides faculty
			    with a space to dine with colleagues, have attracted more faculty to eat at
			    ’53 Commons. The increasing presence of College faculty at the dining hall
			    has allowed him to become familiar with faculty members he might not have
			    otherwise encountered, he said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Marsh, however, said that the College has felt increasingly impersonal and
			    corporate, adding that Dartmouth’s previously-existing personal culture set
			    it apart from other universities.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Hickox said that he has not observed any degradation in the College’s
			    ideals of civility, respect, empathy and rigor in his time at the College.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Most of the things that I see happening on campus give me a very positive
			    sense of where the community is going,” he said. “The vast majority of the
			    interactions that I see [occurring between students] are really positive.”

			<h1> Senior Varsity Co-Captains Reflect On Close Team Bonds </h1>
			<h3> By: Nathan Albrinck </h3>
			<img src="images/football by Hollye Swinehart.jpg" width = "550" height = "380" align = "left" hspace = "50" vspace = "50">
			<p>
			    Dartmouth’s athletic programs aren’t as flashy as Duke University
			    basketball or Ohio State University football, but to those undergraduates
			    at the College who are varsity athletes, their teams are just as important
			    as the teams playing high-profile games on national television.
			</p>
			<p>
			    For football co-captain Folarin Orimolade ’17, playing at Dartmouth changed
			    his “life for the better.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    “It was an amazing feeling to be a part of such an amazing institution with
			    a storied tradition,” Orimolade said. “The team in particular has meant so
			    much to me.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Like many members of the team, Orimolade has invested countless hours into
			    the football program, resulting in the formation of a strong bond among
			    members.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “When you’re so focused on the goal of winning a game and the preparation
			    for that, and you’re spending all this time working out with each other,
			    watching film with each other, fighting with each other, it makes for a
			    close-knit bond that can’t be broken by anything,” Orimolade said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    In addition to mandatory practice and film sessions, the football team eats
			    together almost every day, in and out of season. With all their shared
			    time, on and off the field, Orimolade’s teams have compiled an impressive
			    27-13 four-year record. The senior himself finished his career second
			    all-time in sacks for the Big Green with 23.5 and was the 2016 Ivy League
			    Defensive Player of the Year.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Similarly, James Hickok ’17, the goalkeeper and captain for the men’s
			    soccer team, experienced success on the field and noted how close he is to
			    his teammates. Hickok considers the seven seniors on the soccer team to be
			    his closest friends, and he currently lives with five of them.
			</p>
			<p>
			    This past fall, Hickok helped lead Dartmouth to the second round of the
			    NCAA tournament. His seven shutouts during his senior season are tied for
			    fourth most in a single season in Dartmouth soccer history.
			</p>
			<p>
			    While there are many positives to participating in varsity athletics,
			    working as both a student and an athlete simultaneously is not easy. For
			    Orimolade and Hickok, the commitment is unyielding.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “[The season] consumes your mental capacity, more than even your time,
			    because you have games coming up, and you’re always worried about your
			    performance,” Hickok said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Even on top of their already busy schedules, many student-athletes choose
			    to participate in various extracurricular and volunteer activities. Hickok
			    knows teammates involved in all sorts of off-field activities, from band
			    and the arts to mentorship programs off-campus.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “We try to do our best as a team to get involved in fundraisers and events
			    that [the athletic department] throws,” Hickok said. “You don’t have time
			    like you do out of season to do things like skiing though. In season,
			    soccer is a focus almost around the clock.”
			</p>
			<img src="images/Floren 2 by Saphfire Brown.jpg" width = "550" height = "380" align = "left" hspace = "50" vspace = "50">
			<p>
			    Orimolade, who has taken four classes in each of his last three terms,
			    knows the struggle of balancing athletics and academics as well as anyone.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Your time is essentially gone from two to eight o’clock, and you have
			    class before that,” Orimolade said. “It’s a struggle to find time
			    sometimes. You always make time for whatever’s important to you though.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Midway through his seventh season with the school, athletic director Harry
			    Sheehy prides the athletic department on its continued commitment to
			    academics.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “The experience academically comes first,” Sheehy said. “We talk about a
			    balance between academics and athletics, but I think academics should be
			    the heavier weight. Our students have chosen to come here to a Division I
			    Ivy League program so obviously the demands are significant. Learning to
			    balance those things and to make good decisions is all part of growing up.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Through programs like Dartmouth Peak Performance, Sheehy and the athletic
			    department incorporate academics into their athletic sphere. Dartmouth has
			    led Division I programs in six-year graduation rate in four of the last
			    five years and has led Division I programs in Academic Progress Rate in
			    each of the last four. The Academic Progress Rate rates NCAA varsity teams
			    on a scale from one to 1000, and is a measure of athletes’ academic
			    performance and retention.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “What we do in athletics is not academic in nature, but it is certainly
			    educational in nature,” Sheehy said. “I look at these 35 varsity teams and
			    our club programs as learning laboratories to help the young folks mature
			    and gain confidence and strength to be able to perform at their highest
			    level. We’re trying to bring assets to bear that will enable our athletes
			    to have great success on the field and off the field.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Sheehy fosters the connection between the athletic administration and the
			    teams he overlooks by getting out of his office as much as he can and
			    working with the teams directly. He visits every team captain to talk about
			    goals and challenges before the season gets underway. In addition to
			    continued contact with coaches, he regularly speaks to entire Dartmouth
			    teams. For Sheehy, there is no disconnect between coaches, professors,
			    students, athletes and administrators at Dartmouth.
			</p>
			<p>
			    He sees the athletic programs as important in unifying the Dartmouth
			    community.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “No one feels the same way about anything of importance, but if we’re
			    playing Harvard [University] in Homecoming football, for three hours
			    virtually the whole stadium feels the same way,” he said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Especially at a college with an immensely diverse range of viewpoints,
			    athletics are in a unique position to rally the student body behind a
			    single cause. Just ask any of the hundreds of students who waited in line
			    outside Thompson Arena for the hockey game against Princeton University.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “We bring the community on board with us as we try to have success,” Sheehy
			    said.

			<h1> Faculty Attracted to the Teaching Atmosphere at the College </h1>
			<h3> By: Marie-Capucine Pineau-Valencienne </h3>
			<p>
			    When we think of “Dartmouth,” we think of our friends, our scenic campus
			    and of course, our professors — but do the faculty at the College also feel
			    a unique sense of community? One of the most defining elements of a
			    “Dartmouth education” is learning what the word “community” really means.
			    At Dartmouth our sense of community sets our experience apart from others
			    and what, ironically, binds us all together. There is a reason why
			    Dartmouth has one of the most loyal and far-reaching alumni networks.
			    There’s a reason why alumni and families religiously flood into Hanover
			    every Homecoming weekend. And there’s a reason why the student body as a
			    whole is seemingly clothed in one particular shade of green. That reason?
			    Community.
			</p>
			<img src="images/Faculty Lounge by Saphfire Brown.jpg" width = "550" height = "380" align = "left" hspace = "50" vspace = "50">
			<p>
			    The concept of “Dartmouth” is much more than a charming New England Ivy
			    League institution. It’s much more than the pretty facade of Dartmouth Hall
			    or the echo of the clock in Baker Tower. The Dartmouth we know and love is
			    composed of the people who populate and give life to our seemingly idyllic
			    campus. Our vigorous sense of community is a reflection of not only the
			    dynamic student body but also the faculty who captain our big green ship.
			</p>
			<p>
			    According to history professor Edward Miller, who has taught at the College
			    for 13 years, there is in fact “a very strong community among the faculty
			    at Dartmouth.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    As I spoke to different professors about why they decided to stay at
			    Dartmouth, I quickly realized that our hybrid identity as both an
			    undergraduate college and a top-tier research university was one of the
			    most attractive aspects to many of the long-residing faculty.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Dartmouth is the only school I know of that really tries to split the
			    difference, that really emphasizes that they want their faculty to be both
			    excellent teachers and cutting edge outstanding researchers,” Miller said.
			    “And so for me that’s the most distinctive thing about Dartmouth.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    According to Miller, another benefit of teaching at Dartmouth is the size
			    of the faculty community. He said that the College has a large enough
			    faculty group to introduce diversity, though it is not as big as other
			    high-level research universities.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “At some of these large research universities you can spend your whole
			    career there and never get to know people in many other departments because
			    the community is just too big,” Miller said. “Here at Dartmouth, if you
			    stay here long enough you will meet most of your colleagues, even in other
			    departments and other divisions.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Miller added that he likes that his “primary home,” the history department,
			    is medium-sized, because it allows faculty in the department to specialize
			    in their teaching.
			</p>
			<img src="images/Faculty Lounge 2 by Saphfire Brown.jpg" width = "550" height = "380" align = "left" hspace = "50" vspace = "50">
			<p>
			    “You can teach courses on the area of your research specialty,” he said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Dean of the faculty of arts and sciences and government professor Michael
			    Mastanduno, who has been a faculty member at the College for over 30 years,
			    echoed Miller’s sentiments on Dartmouth’s “rare” balance between teaching
			    and research.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Dartmouth is a place where it really brings the two together, and it gives
			    faculty members time and resources to be leading scholars but also creates
			    a culture where the undergraduate experience is a top priority,” Mastanduno
			    said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Mastanduno said he observed how many of the faculty “really engage in the
			    culture here.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    “It’s a small community, but it’s also cultural,” he said. “There’s a sense
			    here, for example, that faculty members feel they should participate in the
			    governance of the school.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Mastanduno added that faculty are involved in the College community through
			    their engagement in its governance. Faculty care about their colleagues and
			    the success of the institution, he said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Even those who never envisioned a career in academia have found a home at
			    Dartmouth. After working on economic policy in Washington, D.C. and
			    Chicago, Illinois, economics professor Douglas Irwin said he knew that he
			    wanted to pursue a career in academia, but for his wife, fellow economics
			    professor Marjorie Rose, the feeling was not exactly mutual. The couple,
			    who have been staples of the Dartmouth economics department for 19 years,
			    explained how slowly but surely, Rose came to adopt Dartmouth as a new home
			    for their family.
			</p>
			<p>
			    In the process of acclimating to her new career path after leaving her job
			    at the International Monetary Fund in D.C., Rose said she discovered a love
			    for teaching she never knew she had before.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “I just love teaching Dartmouth students,” she said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Rose and Irwin described that being both a couple and professors in the
			    same department has ultimately allowed them to become better educators.
			    They explained how they are able to lean on each other and ask, “What are
			    the things that are interesting to our students?”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Irwin and Rose said they found a community at the College through their
			    relationship with their students. For nine years now the couple said they
			    have hosted “senior women dinners” at their home. They added that
			    conversations during one of these student dinners was the “impetus for the
			    Political Economy Project,” a program directed by Irwin.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Similarly, Miller and Mastanduno also said their students were an important
			    reason that they were inclined to engage in the Dartmouth community.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “I really do think that the students are the best thing about Dartmouth,”
			    Miller said. “I think that as a group, you will not find a group of
			    undergraduates who are more committed to learning for learning’s sake.”

			<h1> Through the Looking Glass: Dartmouth's Mythical Community </h1>
			<h3> By: Emily Burack </h3>
			<p>
			    Winters at Dartmouth are my favorite terms. Winters in general are my
			    favorite time — there is something magical in the beginning of the year,
			    the promise of something new and the hope for many snow days. I have been
			    on campus every winter, and I have come to appreciate this hated term for
			    slightly shorter lines at the Collis Center and a general acceptance of not
			    going out on Friday nights. I have also come to appreciate how much my
			    winters here have taught me about Dartmouth’s mythical community.
			</p>
			<img src="images/Emily Burack courtesy.jpg" align = "left" hspace = "50" vspace = "50">
			<p>
			    I say “mythical” because I’m not sure Dartmouth’s community really exists.
			    Dartmouth’s community is advertised as this passionate, loving,
			    all-consuming entity in which first-years feel welcomed from the moment
			    they step onto Robo lawn during Trips. While that welcoming spirit is
			    undeniably present at many moments, Dartmouth’s community feels fractured
			    to me.
			</p>
			<p>
			    My first winter, I learned how much I could hate Dartmouth. I was not
			    taking hard classes, and it was snowing a lot, which should both be
			    positive things, but I was floundering in search for something that could
			    be mine and a place where I could feel at home. Memories of fall of my
			    first year feel hazy and overwhelming. Nothing stuck from that fall besides
			    my academics (taking History 24, “The Cold War &amp; American Life,” was
			    the best decision I have made in my time here — that professor is now my
			    thesis advisor). That failure to find solid ground in the fall — I joined
			    no clubs and became a member of no groups — translated to feeling lost in
			    this supposedly close community. I learned a lot that winter about the
			    worst in people; simultaneously, I realized how much I longed to find a
			    community within Dartmouth, because “Dartmouth” as a community just was not
			    enough. Being a Dartmouth student gives you a sense of camaraderie, not
			    necessarily a supportive community. Whether or not communities, by default,
			    must be supportive is a question for another day. But in my imagination, in
			    a community, people actively care for one another. That winter, I didn’t
			    feel cared for.
			</p>
			<p>
			    My second winter, I began to find spaces that cared for me. Beginning to
			    work out what I had valued over my first year and a half, I realized the
			    communities I valued were exclusively female. In the female-dominated
			    social spaces and the group chats that were never silent, I began to build
			    my community out of the women here. That same winter, I took Religion 20.2,
			    “Magic, Science &amp; Religion,” hoping to learn about magical worlds (we
			    did not). That term I learned the magical world was not some alternate
			    universe but finding magic in the mundane of Dartmouth: in the pleasures of
			    sending music to friends, in the dependency of a weekly lunch date, in
			    teaching skiing and in beginning to find my voice about how I felt toward
			    Dartmouth. I started writing more; I remember best a piece for Mouth
			    entitled, “How are you?” about how fake our daily interactions here are and
			    an anonymous submission to Voices that winter. At Voices, when a girl
			    walked out onto the stage and began telling my story, tears started
			    streaming down my face. My friends enveloped me in hugs and held me and
			    reassured me that my story was important and I didn’t sound stupid. These
			    women caring for me reminded me that I had found my own little community
			    here at Dartmouth.
			</p>
			<p>
			    My third winter, I found joy in Dartmouth. Not for the first time, but for
			    the most sustained time. I wasn’t taking classes, and the issues that
			    typically characterize my terms here – insurmountable workloads and stress
			    – faded away into research I enjoyed, wintery adventures that let me
			    explore the beauty of the Upper Valley and dedicated viewings of “Jane the
			    Virgin.” Happiness is so fleeting here; one moment, I can feel so happy and
			    so content, thinking, “Wow, I love this place,” and the next, I feel so
			    dejected and drained that I don’t know how I have ever enjoyed school. But
			    that winter, that third winter, reminded me of all the love that exists in
			    my life because of Dartmouth. All the magic of music blitzes and yummy
			    sandwiches on sourdough bread and drinking good beer with good friends.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Now, during my final winter, I am struggling to reconcile the moments of
			    magic in this place and this community with the moments where I feel as
			    lost as I did that first winter. I try to understand how a place that has
			    brought me my closest friends and helped me uncover my academic passions
			    has also been extraordinarily challenging and draining. I am trying to help
			    spaces and communities I belong to and care deeply about become more
			    inclusive. But I struggle with how communities premised on exclusivity,
			    like Dartmouth itself, can ever be considered inclusive. I am frustrated by
			    the failures of our community, from the small to the large, and the current
			    inability of Dartmouth to make every student on this campus feel supported
			    and protected. I am frustrated by the trust that should be there in a
			    hookup that is not, by the lack of support for the most marginalized
			    students here and by the notion that one Dartmouth community fits all.
			</p>
			<p>
			    During the winter, Dartmouth is the best, even though it can sometimes be
			    the worst. It reminds me that I love snow days more than anything. It
			    reminds me that not everyone can understand Dartmouth’s community the way I
			    do, and I can’t understand it as my peers do. Everyone at this school has
			    competing views of Dartmouth, not only as the school ought to be but as it
			    exists. Trying to reconcile these divergent views of a place we all share
			    to form one opinion on Dartmouth’s community is just not possible. But I
			    know this: I would take my friendships, the women who have made this place
			    meaningful and magical, over this large and mythical community any day.

			<h1> The Places We Make </h1>
			<h3> By: Matthew Brown </h3>
			<p>
			    There is a lot to the name “Dartmouth.” The Dartmouth of today bears almost
			    no resemblance to the College on the Hill that Eleazar Wheelock founded in
			    1769. The school itself has grown to become one of the wealthiest and most
			    storied universities in the country, with a brand that has swelled in
			    tandem. The student body is larger, multi-ethnic, multi-national,
			    gender-inclusive and home to many amazing minds and talents. These are all
			    expected markers of the 21st century university, but reflecting on how
			    drastically Dartmouth has evolved over the years demonstrates that this
			    place is made up by those who inhabit it. The name “Dartmouth” is defined
			    by its community; everything that the name connotes is the product of our
			    shared actions. That also means that people’s perception of this place will
			    vary depending on what part of the community they have come to know. You
			    learn that just by wandering around campus.
			</p>
			<p>
			    At the same time as crowds hop up and down Webster Avenue, there are
			    theatrical works being put on at the Hopkins Center for the Art, and spoken
			    word performed in One Wheelock. Groundbreaking research and last-minute
			    problem sets are completed while a student band plays to a packed crowd. On
			    any given day, there are club events, Greek life activities, nature
			    outings, art shows, socials and sporting events of every level for campus
			    to engage in. We pride ourselves on our involvements and interests so much
			    that we affiliate them with our identities at Dartmouth. For all this
			    supposed diversity of identity and involvement, I consistently feel as if
			    the school is not as interconnected as it should be. Those same communities
			    we find silo too many of us away from the greater community, leading to
			    wildly divergent experiences depending on who you surround yourself with.
			    In a time when understanding those who are not like us has become
			    paramount, I’m concerned that even at our small liberal arts college we
			    still find ways to insulate ourselves.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Discussions on how to build functioning diverse communities shouldn’t be
			    new to Dartmouth students. The debates that embroil campus usually focus on
			    how large, quantifiable groups fit into campus. The Greek system has long
			    been the central pillar of community at Dartmouth, though campus has also
			    debated how to build more inclusive clubs, sports teams, performance groups
			    and social scenes. A central goal of College President Phil Hanlon’s Moving
			    Dartmouth Forward initiative is premised on the idea that you can build
			    community through organizations and social engineering. This is a fair
			    approach, as similar people tend to gravitate toward each other. What’s
			    often overlooked in these talks, however, is the very personal and
			    individualized nature of community building. Community is, after all, just
			    people en masse, united by common bonds. If we as a Dartmouth community are
			    serious about bridging interest, race, wealth and lifestyle divides, then
			    we must be willing to communicate outside of our familiar spaces.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Healthy community building occurs on the individual level. It’s all too
			    natural for us to reduce each other to some demographic or group
			    membership. We don’t make it easier for ourselves when we literally wear
			    our affiliations on our sleeve, whether it be some club, sport, Greek house
			    or housing community. It is a mistake, however, to look at any group as a
			    monolith. Even the most homogenized group is still made up of individuals,
			    all of whom have a unique combination of identities and lived experiences.
			    Humanizing others and coming to respect and accept their differing
			    identities is the first step to creating the bonds that we desire. It is
			    easy to understand and communicate with someone who shares your interests,
			    but it becomes difficult and potentially challenging when differences are
			    more apparent. However, you do not need to be identical to another person
			    to have camaraderie. If we want to build a stronger, more connected campus,
			    then we must take the time to learn about and interact with each other as
			    individuals. Rome wasn’t built in a day — and neither was its culture and
			    identity.
			</p>
			<p>
			    All of this requires that we be fearless in action. In context, it’s a bit
			    strange to call venturing into some party, club or event you’ve never been
			    to before a brave act, but confidence and good faith are often requisite
			    when entering unfamiliar spaces. This principle is key to building
			    community on campus and in society at large. The Balkanization of the
			    Friday night social scene is inevitable, but such differences in expression
			    should never bar us from interacting or sharing in spaces with which we are
			    connected. Dartmouth will always mean many different things to different
			    people, but as students it is necessary to appreciate the fact that there
			    is no one way to “do Dartmouth” and that all communities on this campus,
			    and the school itself, are ours to shape, not the other way around. We
			    should also take the opportunity to learn from the exceptional and diverse
			    student body that is assembled here, as in all likelihood this is the last
			    time that most of us will be surrounded by those unlike us. We owe it to
			    each other to at least acknowledge and respect our classmates as individual
			    people, even if we occupy divergent worlds. This is not a recipe for social
			    harmony, but any step toward a closer-knit campus must start with the
			    one-on-one.

			<h1> Expanding the Bubble </h1>
			<h3> By: Hansa Sharma </h3>
			<p>
			    Communité is the Anglo-French word that gave rise to our English word
			    “community.” Communité signified commonness, everybody — inspiring a warm,
			    fuzzy feeling of wholesomeness. “Community” is one of the first words that
			    came to mind when I first visited Dartmouth during Homecoming in fall of
			    2013. Basking in the glorious peak foliage of New England autumn, I saw
			    alumni — proudly flaunting sweaters from class years way before either of
			    my parents’ birth years — interacting with the eager, albeit nervous,
			    members of the Class of 2017 getting ready to take part in the “cultish”
			    tradition of running around the spectacular bonfire as the newest members
			    of the Dartmouth collective. My decision was made. I decided to apply to
			    Dartmouth right then and there.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Now in my fifth term at Dartmouth, my definition — and definitely the
			    College’s definition — of community has taken quite a few turns. Under the
			    all-encompassing shadow of the Moving Dartmouth Forward initiative, the
			    Dartmouth community has seen highs and lows, unifying solidarity and
			    strained tensions. These changes have been openly embraced by some parts of
			    the campus population and loudly protested by others. But amidst all this
			    change, one trait has remained constant: Dartmouth’s openness to engage in
			    dialogue and voice dissenting opinions. Whether it is inside classroom
			    walls discussing current events or in public spaces, our communal spirit
			    extends to the macro level. And after the strong reactions that the recent
			    presidential election and its fallout have elicited, our conception of the
			    Dartmouth community is drastically changing and expanding.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Community” is the free space where students and veteran groups from across
			    the Upper Valley can openly protest and express dissenting views. Community
			    is fostered through the respect that it takes to step outside of your
			    comfort zone and listen to a story markedly different from yours. After
			    all, inclusion begins with communication. Our campus has been very
			    receptive to initiating dialogues that, at times, may involve uncomfortable
			    and sensitive issues but ultimately lend themselves to a robust worldview.
			    In this time of change, it is important to be cognizant of our attempts at
			    inclusion so that we do not unintentionally create exclusionary practices.
			</p>
			<p>
			    After the inauguration, 3.3 million people participated in a Women’s March
			    against the policies of President Donald Trump throughout the country,
			    including several groups of Dartmouth students and alumnae. These events
			    featured speeches from public figures across the political spectrum and
			    galvanized many to stand up for their rights and their fellow citizens’
			    rights, under threat now more than ever.
			</p>
			<p>
			    The Women’s March is a shining example of our most essential and innate
			    constitutional right as American citizens: the right to assemble and
			    protest. That right has fueled the birth and growth of the country we all
			    lovingly call our own: the United States of America.
			</p>
			<p>
			    But despite this apparent unity, divisions remain. Not all women agree
			    about Trump and his policies. In achieving victory, he carried the votes of
			    42 percent of women — including 53 percent of white women. Many have
			    discussed the marginalization of working-class white voters in the Rust
			    Belt and their dissatisfaction with former Democratic presidential
			    candidate Hillary Clinton, perceived as one of the key factors that
			    propelled Trump to his victory in key states like Ohio and Wisconsin.
			</p>
			<p>
			    While it is true that many of the policy measures Trump hopes to enact are
			    particularly threatening to women and minority groups, the direct sexism
			    that many protesters see in Trump and his team should not breed indirect
			    sexism in retaliation. This holds true for our Dartmouth community as well.
			    In these politically tumultuous times, it is important to reinforce our
			    values of openness to all opinions in an academic and intellectually
			    stimulating environment. In the microcosm of our College on the Hill, it is
			    easy to trap ourselves in a bubble. But we have to remain mindful of the
			    fact that our community consists of not only the student population but
			    also the communities in the Upper Valley region that have ensured the
			    success of the College from 1769 to the present day. And of course we are
			    also a part of a national community. Let’s hope that inclusion doesn’t end
			    up excluding.

			<h1> See the Forster Through the Trees </h1>
			<h3> By: William Sandlund </h3>
			<p>
			    When I visited a friend in Berkeley, California, I noticed something odd as
			    we sat on a café bench still damp from the rain. Blocking my view of the
			    road were seven battered and disused newspaper vending machines. I pointed
			    them out to my friend, and he remarked sullenly, “Don’t make me look at
			    them any longer; it’s too depressing.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    He had a point. There was something sad and even surreal about those clunky
			    objects that no longer served a purpose. They were forgotten ­— literally
			    left by the wayside. I had needed five minutes just to register their total
			    lack of presence. It was strange to be confronted by a labor-saving device
			    that itself had become obsolete and stranger still to feel emotional about
			    it.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Newspaper vending machines are distant memories for my generation, like a
			    well-loved relative who died in our infant days. I vaguely recall seeing
			    one of these contraptions as a child and being utterly confused even then.
			    I asked my dad, “Why don’t people just take all the newspapers?” He said
			    something about honesty and how most people only need one copy. From my
			    now-jaded perspective, I can understand that it was probably cheaper to
			    have the newspaper vending machine than to pay someone to hawk papers, just
			    as it is now more cost-effective to abandon the device on roadsides across
			    the country than to dispose of them.
			</p>
			<p>
			    While it is sad to behold forgotten times in their rusted forms, there is
			    some comfort in the sentimental caress of history. The push and pull of
			    technological development and obsolescence, guided by market forces, is a
			    permanent fixture in our lives. Even when our good nature is exploited for
			    profit by an object as simple as a newspaper vending machine, you can’t
			    help but admire the simple act of taking just one copy off the top of the
			    stack.
			</p>
			<p>
			    English novelist E.M. Forster saw such common decency as the essence and
			    grace of the human race. In his resonant essay “What I Believe,” published
			    on the eve of World War II, Forster wrote: “The man who is selling
			    newspapers outside the Houses of Parliament can safely leave his papers to
			    go for a drink, and his cap beside them: anyone who takes a paper is sure
			    to drop a copper into the cap. But the men who are inside the Houses of
			    Parliament — they can’t trust one another like that; still less can the
			    government they compose trust other governments.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Forster understood that there is a fundamental understanding in our
			    immediate human interactions that forms the foundation of a peaceful
			    society. He identified a certain type of person who moved through life
			    exuding an essential morality. But this aspect of human nature is as
			    elusive as it is effusive, making it difficult for authority to harness.
			    Perhaps this is because, as Forster reminds us, the threat of force is the
			    foundation of government, while such intuitive decency is an altruistic
			    quality that is the antithesis of physical violence.
			</p>
			<p>
			    People have vastly different opinions on the state of the nation today, but
			    in general there is undeniable tension on a national and global level. In
			    times that are as divisive as ours, there is the frequent but politicized
			    rallying cry for unity. To me, President Donald Trump’s call for “total
			    allegiance to the United States of America” feels empty and frightening not
			    just because of my dislike for our new leader but also because vapid
			    nationalism is transferrable to any nation on earth, democracy or
			    otherwise. It often holds authoritarian regimes together; without it
			    Vladimir Putin would not have an 83 percent approval rating. One of the
			    characteristics of democracies is a reflexive division and fragmentation,
			    and we should revel in the contrarian clamor, however partisan.
			</p>
			<p>
			    When a good friend of mine recently told me that he voted for Trump, my
			    first reaction was to say, “Why do we have such different political views?”
			    The discussion that followed was not angry, nor was it particularly
			    interesting. What is apparent is that friendship made it somewhat pleasant
			    and even funny. Sadly, this is not how national discourse plays out. It is
			    inevitably petty, simplistic and sometimes violent.
			</p>
			<p>
			    A protestor was shot in the days after the inauguration at the University
			    of Washington, and there was a violent protest at the University of
			    California, Berkeley last week. Whether we are entering a new era of
			    violent discourse is not yet clear. If we are, the national debate will
			    only become more simplistic and petty, with finger pointing and accusations
			    of “They started it!” becoming even more common.
			</p>
			<p>
			    At the heart of these developments is how the debate over debate itself has
			    developed. The argument over what divides free speech from hate speech has
			    only intensified in the Trump era and it deserves a much longer discussion
			    than I can give here.
			</p>
			<p>
			    In order to have the intellectual confrontations we crave, at least one
			    group must abstain from physical force and be a champion of common decency.
			    Otherwise, the communities we participate in will be strained to the point
			    where calls for unquestioning American unity will sound appealing rather
			    than terrifying.

			<h1>Verbum Ultimum: Resilience in Community</h1>
			<h3>By: The Dartmouth Editorial Board</h3>			
			<p>
			Wednesday nights at Dartmouth are usually lively. In Greek houses across campus, affiliated women and men congregate for weekly bonding festivities, and crowds of students gather in living rooms to watch a cappella groups perform. The faint sound of music emanating from fraternity basements hangs over Webster Avenue as groups of students brave the Hanover winter nights. Collis Late Night, Domino’s Pizza and Everything But Anchovies see to it that the night doesn’t end until we’ve indulged.
			</p>
			<p>
			Last week was different. On Wednesday night, Webster Avenue was silent enough to hear a pin drop in the snow. The Interfraternity Council had sent out a campus-wide email that all fraternities would be closed for the night. The crowds that would have gathered in fraternity basements instead gathered on Beta Alpha Omega fraternity’s lawn to commemorate the life of Adam Wright ’17, a Beta brother, a friend, a student, a member of our Dartmouth community.
			</p>
			<p>
			At the College, where approximately 4,300 undergraduates inhabit a secluded rural campus quiety located in the middle of nowhere, each person carries a weighty presence. Each of us is closely tied to something: to an organization, a society, our Greek affiliation, our friends, our peers. If every person on Earth is separated by no more than six degrees, then every person on this campus is family.
			</p>
			<p>
			There is a special sense of community at Dartmouth that manifests itself in every type of social situation. First-year trips exposes us to this odd, and arguably cultish, form of camaraderie. This five-day adventure with fellow freshmen welcomes us into Dartmouth’s family, where tutus, crazy hair colors and animal onesies reign.
			</p>
			<p>
			Moreover, this sense of community is fluid enough to fit a diversity of circumstances. The flag burning demonstration on the Green led by Timothy Messen ’18 was a situation that had the potential to become inflammatory, yet it evolved into a dialogue where opposing sides could vocalize their opinions with the guarantee that the other side would listen and respond. GroupMes for Dartmouth organizations are conversational outlets for a healthy combination of crude comedy and honest debate. Workshops, panels and group discussions provide open forums to discuss difficult issues and controversial current events, while dinner conversations between friends provide a similar purpose in a more intimate setting.
			</p>
			<p>
			The Dartmouth community is one that none of us can help but immerse ourselves in. No matter how involved we choose to be, we all contribute to this madness. It’s embedded in our language, exemplified by terms like “Foco,” “tails” and “flair.” We realize just how unusual our learned language is when we’re on the phone with our friends from home and have to translate from the Dartmouth dictionaries that we’ve catalogued in our brains. It’s embedded in our lifestyles, from our “work-hard-play-hard” mentality to our shared battle every fall to survive the freshman plague.
			We, as Dartmouth students, have allowed ourselves to become a part of a collective even as we still manage to maintain a high degree of individuality. We are not just running blind with the pack; we are engineering majors who talk about literature and art majors who know everything about politics. We choose to be a part of the pack for its ability to enrich our lives. We join organizations and make affiliations not for the promise of having friends and people to tag in Facebook photos, but for the conversations and events that make our Dartmouth experiences so life-changing. We immerse ourselves in the collective not just because it guarantees that we will have people to eat dinner with and parties to attend, but because we teach each other empathy and we offer unique narratives.
			</p>
			<p>
			Dartmouth is an inherently communal place, but we are not so collectivized that we lose our individuality. We are a community that is capable of going beyond the surface level. In the wake of Wright’s passing, we saw our Dartmouth community bend under the weight. When grief hits, certain individuals will be affected more than others, but grief touches all parts of a community. The resiliency of this community is deeply rooted and unbreakable because each of us who chooses to be a part of the collective takes a share of the burden. It is far more bearable to be hit by disaster with others who can help carry some of the weight than it is to bear it alone.
			</p>
			<p>
			Dartmouth is many things, but the beauty of Dartmouth transcends the flair that we wear, our beloved cultish rituals and the stateliness of Baker Tower. It comes from the dirt and the grit underneath the centuries-old buildings that our community has worked so hard to keep pristine. There is beauty in admitting that we’re not doing well in a place where there is such high expectation to do well — and there’s beauty in how we feel at the end of a long night as we kick off our shoes and get ready to sleep before another day.
			</p>
			<p>
			In the same communal spaces that we socialize in on weekends, we also share our personal struggles, discuss controversial issues and gather together in solidarity to mourn the loss of a fellow member of our community. The fluidity of the Dartmouth community is what makes us unbreakable in times of distress. While no one is supposed to see the cracks and the peeling paint, this side of our community is the most honest and beautiful perspective that Dartmouth offers because it is a testament to our resiliency in a system that relentlessly pushes us.
