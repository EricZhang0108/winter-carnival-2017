			<h1>A New Model For Housing</h1>
			<h3>Subtitle: How are Dartmouth students old and new responding to the new housing system? A look at both the successes and shortcomings of Dartmouth’s residential communities.</h3>
			<p class="by-line">By: Alexa Green</p>
			<img src="img/article_photos/New Housing Communities Photo 1.jpg">
			<p>Last winter, Dartmouth introduced a new residential life model as part of College President Phil Hanlon’s “Moving Dartmouth Forward” initiative. The College’s stated purpose in creating these six new housing communities is to foster more opportunities for intellectual engagement through social encounters among students, faculty and staff. House professors, undergraduate advisors, graduate student fellows, student leadership teams and affiliated faculty are all involved in the Houses.</p>
			<p>In a recent survey conducted by The Dartmouth, 46.2 percent of students surveyed had a favorable view toward the new housing system, while 17.1 percent had an unfavorable view. Yet despite this numerical admittance of favorability, the survey found that the housing communities continue to face issues with engaging upperclass students.
			<p>Event attendance drastically differs between upperclassmen and underclassmen. The survey found that 40 percent of ’17s have not attended any events, while 48 percent have attended just one. Fifty percent of the surveyed ’18s and 40 percent of the surveyed ’19s have attended none of the events. However, 86.6 percent of surveyed ’20s have attended more than one of the housing community events.</p>
			<p>“There is a certain level of enthusiasm among the ’20s and the ’19s regarding the communities because they’re the ones invested in it,” School House professor Craig Sutton said. “They don’t know any different.”</p>
			<p>Despite living in first-year-only residential housing, Daniella Kubiak ’20  said that members of her class are making an effort to bond with others in their houses, as they know that they will be living with one another in the coming years. She has gone to ice cream socials for her house in the Choates, she said, though lately she has been too busy to attend them.</p>
			<p>Building a social and intellectual community is one of the main goals of the house professors. Allen House professor Jane Hill hosted a subset of the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra in her home earlier last week. Ten students and seven faculty members attended the event.</p>
			<p>Other events hosted by the different housing communities include an apple picking trip, intramural sports teams, dance and musical performances, a barbecue class on how to smoke meat taught by computer science professor Thomas Cormen and a presentation by war photographer James Nachtwey ’70. East Wheelock House professor Sergi Elizalde also hosted a dinner for those affected by the Morton Hall fire.
			<p>Elizalde said that an average of 20 students show up to the community’s events.</p>
			<p>“We are aiming to create this vertically integrated, intellectual community where there are not a lot of boundaries separating students and faculty in the events,” Sutton said.</p>
			<p>However, upperclassmen seem to be less inclined to participate. As a Dartmouth student who has been off for the past two terms, Matt Ferguson ’18 said he was not a part of Founder’s Day in the spring in which students found out their house assignments and has not been involved in with his house community.</p>
			<img src="img/article_photos/A New Model For Housing.jpg">
			<p>“It was never part of my Dartmouth dorm experience and never will be,” he said. “I don’t feel involved whatsoever.”</p>
			<p>Ferguson added that he feels guilty because his house professor is excited about the community building events, yet he does not participate in them.</p>
			<p>Noah Manning ’17, a member of West House’s student working committee, said he strongly believes in the merit of residential life.</p>
			<p>“We all acknowledge that upperclassmen buy-in is going to be a tougher part of this process, but I think there is an upperclassmen buy-in,” he said.</p>
			<p>Manning argued that the housing community programming acts as a complement to student life. Because many programs are hosted within student dorms, upperclassmen living in those houses can easily wander in and participate, he said.</p>
			<p>Yet the formation of such communities has faced structural obstacles.</p>
			<p>“Right now, we are trying to graft a system onto existing facilities,” Sutton said. “As fundraising occurs, we will be able to build a residential system that actually fits this housing model. We are in a transition period.”</p>
			<p>The housing communities, specifically East Wheelock, have also had issues with housing all of their students. Thuyen Tran ’19 is currently living in the Channing Cox senior apartments instead of in her own housing community.</p>
			<p>“Because I had such a low priority number, by the time it was time for me to choose my room, there were no rooms left for me in East Wheelock,” said Tran. “I got into [Living Learning Community] housing, but they also waitlisted me because there was no room for me in the fall.”</p>
			<p>The housing department told Tran that she could wait for someone to change their D-Plan and then move in or live in Channing Cox.</p>
			<p>“Sophomores are guaranteed housing and they had no availabilities in my community,” Tran said. “A week before I needed to be on campus, I was really freaking out.”</p>
			<p>Ryan Spector ’19 is also a member of the East Wheelock housing community. Rather than living in the senior apartments, he and his roommate are living in a converted study room in McCulloch Hall.</p>
			<p>Like Tran, Spector and his roommate also had poor housing numbers. They were unconcerned because they were on the waitlist and the College guarantees sophomores housing.</p>
			<p>During the summer, however,  Spector and his roommate would receive weekly emails from director of housing Rachael Class-Giguere indicating that no housing was available. Class-Giguere gave the two the option of living in Channing Cox. </p>
			<p>“When they were able to finally get us a room, it turned out that it was a study room that had been converted to serve as a residence,” he said.</p>
			<p>Spector feels that the conversion of the study room into a residential space has had several shortcomings.</p>
			<p>“The whole back wall and door are windows,” he said. “Also, each room has a placard outside the door saying its room number and ours says ‘Study Room.’ Two people entered the room by accident during the first few days of living there.”</p>
			<p>Spector expressed dissatisfaction with the arrangement.</p>
			<p>“It’s unacceptable, to be totally honest,” he said. “I was essentially told there were no other options because there are so few living arrangements on campus.”</p>
			<p>Class-Giguere noted that each housing community has more students than beds. This was planned because not all members would be enrolled at the same time, nor would all of them want to live on campus, she said. She added that during fall term students are over-enrolled.</p>
			<p>“Even before the housing system, when we don’t have enough space, we have to look at other options,” she said. “The enrollment is so high and the demand is so high; it exceeds what we have readily available.”</p>
			<p>Despite the bumps, professors are optimistic about the potential of the new housing system. Elizalde served as faculty associate for the East Wheelock cluster before the implementation of the new housing system, the cluster was a standalone community structured similarly to the new houses. He attributed East Wheelock’s strong sense of community to the interconnected structure of the cluster.</p>
			<p>“With the house communities, hopefully there will be six of these,” he added.</p>
